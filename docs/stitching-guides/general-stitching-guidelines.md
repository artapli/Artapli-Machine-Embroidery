# General Stitching Guidelines

> Machine-agnostic best practices for hooping, stabilization, and quality embroidery results

## Overview

This guide provides general setup and stitching recommendations applicable to all embroidery designs. These practices apply across all machine brands and formats.

## Hooping

### Fabric Preparation

1. **Pre-wash fabric** if final garment will be washed (prevents post-embroidery shrinkage)
2. **Press fabric** smooth before hooping
3. **Check grain line** - fabric should be squared and not stretched diagonally

### Hooping Technique

1. Place stabilizer in hoop first (bottom hoop)
2. Lay fabric smooth over stabilizer
3. Press top hoop firmly into place
4. **Critical**: Fabric should be taut like a drum, but not stretched
5. Gently tug fabric edges to ensure even tension
6. No wrinkles or puckers should be visible

### Hooping Tension Guidelines

- **Too loose**: Fabric will shift during stitching, causing registration problems
- **Too tight**: Fabric will pucker when released from hoop
- **Correct**: Fabric is taut and smooth, returns to original dimensions when unhooped

## Stabilizer Selection

### Stabilizer Types

| Type | Uses | Removal Method |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Cutaway** | Knits, stretchy fabrics, towels, heavy stitch count designs | Trim excess, remains in garment permanently |
| **Tearaway** | Wovens, quilting cotton, stable fabrics, low stitch count | Tear away after stitching |
| **Washaway** | Toppers for textured fabrics (terry, fleece, corduroy) | Dissolve in water |
| **Sticky/Adhesive** | Items that cannot be hooped (socks, collars, pre-made items) | Tear away or cutaway with adhesive |

### Stabilizer Weight Guidelines

- **Light (1.5 oz)**: Low stitch count designs on stable wovens
- **Medium (2.0-2.5 oz)**: Most standard embroidery designs
- **Heavy (3.0+ oz)**: High-density designs, large fill areas, specialty techniques

### Specialty Technique Stabilizer Requirements

- **Appliqué**: Medium tearaway or cutaway
- **Fringe**: Standard stabilizer (technique does not stress fabric)
- **Puffy Foam**: Medium cutaway (foam designs are dense)
- **3D/FSL**: Medium to heavy washaway (design must be self-supporting)

## Thread

### Thread Types

- **Polyester**: Most durable, colorfast, suitable for all techniques
- **Rayon**: High sheen, vivid colors, less durable (not recommended for fringe designs)
- **Cotton**: Matte finish, soft appearance, moderate durability

### Thread Weight

- **40wt**: Standard embroidery thread (most common)
- **60wt**: Fine detail work, small lettering
- **12wt**: Heavy decorative stitching, topstitching effects

## Needles

### Needle Types

| Type | Uses |
|------|------|
| **Sharp (75/11, 80/12)** | Standard embroidery on wovens |
| **Ballpoint (75/11, 80/12)** | Knits, puffy foam (creates larger hole) |
| **Metallic (90/14)** | Metallic threads (larger eye prevents shredding) |
| **Topstitch (90/14)** | Heavy threads, topstitching |

### Needle Maintenance

- Change needle every 8-10 hours of stitching or every 3-4 projects
- Dull needles cause skipped stitches, thread breaks, and fabric damage
- Inspect needle tip for burrs or bends

## Thread Tension

### Balanced Tension

Properly balanced tension shows:
- Top thread visible on top surface
- Bobbin thread visible on reverse
- No thread loops or loose stitches on either side
- Thread "lock" occurs between fabric layers (not visible on either surface)

### Tension Adjustments

- **Top thread too tight**: Bobbin thread pulls to top surface → Loosen top tension
- **Top thread too loose**: Top thread loops on reverse → Tighten top tension
- **General rule**: Adjust top tension first; adjust bobbin tension only if necessary

## Machine Settings

### Standard Settings for Most Designs

- **Speed**: 600-850 SPM (stitches per minute)
- **Tension**: Balanced (typically 3-4 on home machines)
- **Presser foot pressure**: Medium
- **Auto-trim**: Enabled (if available)
- **Thread break detection**: Enabled (if available)

### Speed Considerations

- **Slower (400-600 SPM)**: Complex designs, thick fabrics, metallic threads
- **Medium (600-850 SPM)**: Standard designs, most projects
- **Faster (850-1000 SPM)**: Simple fills, production work (only on capable machines)

## Pre-Stitch Checklist

Before starting any design:

1. ✓ Fabric is hooped taut and smooth
2. ✓ Correct stabilizer type and weight is used
3. ✓ Needle type and size is appropriate for fabric and technique
4. ✓ Needle is sharp (not dull or bent)
5. ✓ Thread is properly threaded through all guides and tension discs
6. ✓ Bobbin is full and properly inserted
7. ✓ Design is centered in hoop and positioned correctly on garment
8. ✓ Thread colors are loaded in correct sequence

## Test Stitching

**Always test stitch on scrap fabric** using the same fabric, stabilizer, and thread as final project. Test stitching reveals:

- Tension problems
- Stabilizer adequacy
- Color accuracy
- Registration issues
- Technique-specific problems (fringe, foam, appliqué)

## Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Design puckers after stitching | Insufficient stabilizer or too-tight hooping | Use heavier stabilizer; check hooping tension |
| Thread breaks frequently | Dull needle, too-tight tension, or low-quality thread | Change needle; adjust tension; use quality thread |
| Skipped stitches | Dull or wrong needle type, timing issue | Change to sharp needle; service machine if persists |
| Registration errors (design misaligned) | Fabric shifted in hoop | Re-hoop with correct tension; check hoop stability |
| Bobbin thread shows on top | Top tension too tight | Loosen top tension slightly |
| Design shrinks after washing | Fabric not pre-washed | Pre-wash fabric before embroidery |

## Design File Best Practices

### DO:
- Use original design files without modification
- Import designs with "optimization" and "auto-reduce" disabled
- Test stitch before production
- Keep backup copies of original files

### DO NOT:
- Resize specialty designs (fringe, puffy foam, appliqué, chain stitch, 3D effects)
- Use "reduce stitches" on professionally digitized designs
- Convert between formats with auto-optimization enabled
- Combine incompatible stitch types (mixing appliqué and fringe, for example)

## Fabric-Specific Guidelines

### Knits (T-shirts, Jerseys)
- Use cutaway stabilizer
- Ballpoint needle
- May require topper (washaway) to prevent stitches sinking into fabric

### Wovens (Cotton, Linen, Canvas)
- Use tearaway or cutaway stabilizer
- Sharp needle
- Minimal stabilizer needed for low stitch count

### Stretch Fabrics (Spandex, Athletic Wear)
- Use cutaway stabilizer
- Ballpoint or stretch needle
- Do not stretch fabric during hooping

### Terry Cloth/Towels
- Use washaway topper
- Cutaway stabilizer
- Sharp needle
- Compress nap with topper to prevent buried stitches

### Fleece/Minky
- Use washaway topper
- Cutaway stabilizer
- Ballpoint needle
- Compress pile with topper

### Denim/Heavy Fabrics
- Use heavy cutaway stabilizer
- Sharp needle (80/12 or 90/14)
- Slower stitch speed

## When to Seek Help

Contact design provider if:
- Design consistently stitches poorly after following all guidelines
- Design file appears corrupted or incomplete
- Format compatibility issues occur
- Specialty technique instructions are unclear
