# Stitching Instructions: Free-Standing Lace (FSL) and 3D Designs

> Technical guide for stabilizer selection, removal techniques, and assembly procedures for self-supporting embroidery

## Overview

This guide describes the stitch sequence and stabilizer requirements for Free-Standing Lace (FSL) and 3D embroidery designs. FSL creates self-supporting fabric-like structures from thread alone, with no base fabric. 3D designs extend this concept to create dimensional shapes that stand independently or fold into forms.

## Applicable Design Types

- Free-Standing Lace (flat lace designs)
- 3D bowknots and bows
- 3D butterflies and insects
- 3D flowers and ornaments
- 3D assembled structures (requiring multiple pieces)
- Lace napkin rings
- Lace bookmarks and inserts
- Ornamental lace elements

## FSL vs. Standard Embroidery

| Characteristic | FSL/3D Designs | Standard Embroidery |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Base fabric** | None—thread only | Fabric required |
| **Stabilizer** | Water-soluble (washaway) | Tearaway or cutaway |
| **Structure** | Self-supporting after stabilizer removed | Requires fabric support |
| **Stitch density** | Very high (creates fabric-like structure) | Variable |
| **Finishing** | Rinse/dissolve stabilizer | Remove stabilizer by tearing |

## Required Materials

### Stabilizer (Critical Component)

FSL designs REQUIRE water-soluble stabilizer. No substitutions.

#### Stabilizer Types

| Type | Uses | Removal Method |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Water-soluble film (Solvy, Avalon, Ultra Solvy)** | Most FSL designs | Dissolve in water |
| **Heavy water-soluble (Vilene, Sulky Solvy Heavy)** | Dense FSL, 3D structures | Dissolve in warm water |
| **Heat-away (Sulky Heat-Away)** | Alternative for non-washable projects | Apply heat (iron or heat gun) |

#### Stabilizer Quantity

- **Minimum**: 2 layers of medium-weight water-soluble
- **Recommended**: 2-3 layers for most FSL
- **Heavy designs**: 3-4 layers for dense lace or 3D structures
- **Hooping**: Stack layers together and hoop as one unit

### Thread

- **Type**: Polyester embroidery thread (40wt)
- **Rayon**: May be used but is less durable after washing
- **Metallic**: Suitable for decorative FSL (creates shimmery effect)
- **Quality**: Use high-quality thread—FSL has no fabric backing, so thread quality directly affects durability

### Tools

- **Rinse basin**: Large enough to submerge FSL project
- **Towels**: For blotting excess water
- **Drying surface**: Flat towel or drying rack
- **Optional**: Fan for faster air drying
- **Shaping pins** (optional): For pinning FSL flat while drying

## Stitch Sequence

### Step 1: Hoop Stabilizer

1. Stack 2-3 layers of water-soluble stabilizer
2. Hoop layers together
3. **Critical**: Stabilizer must be taut, like fabric
4. No fabric is hooped—stabilizer only

### Step 2: Stitch FSL Design

1. Load FSL design file
2. Stitch design completely
3. FSL designs typically stitch in this order:
   - Underlay/connecting stitches (create structure)
   - Fill stitches (create lace body)
   - Satin borders (finish edges)
4. Design is complete when all colors finish
5. Remove from hoop

### Step 3: Trim Excess Stabilizer

1. Using scissors, trim away excess stabilizer around design
2. Leave approximately 0.5" margin around stitched area
3. Do not pull or stretch FSL at this stage (stabilizer provides support)

### Step 4: Dissolve Stabilizer

#### Method 1: Cold Water Rinse (Most Common)

1. Fill basin with lukewarm or cold water
2. Submerge FSL project
3. Gently agitate water
4. Stabilizer will dissolve (2-10 minutes depending on thickness)
5. Change water if stabilizer creates cloudy/sticky residue
6. Rinse until water runs clear and no sticky residue remains

#### Method 2: Warm Water Rinse (Faster)

1. Use warm (not hot) water to speed dissolution
2. Follow same process as cold water rinse
3. **Warning**: Very hot water may distort thread or reduce luster

#### Method 3: Running Water

1. Hold FSL under gentle running water
2. Rinse until all stabilizer dissolves
3. Effective for lightly stabilized FSL

### Step 5: Remove Excess Water

1. Gently squeeze water from FSL (do not wring or twist)
2. Lay FSL on clean towel
3. Roll towel to absorb water
4. **Do not pull, stretch, or wring FSL while wet**

### Step 6: Shape and Dry

1. Lay FSL flat on dry towel
2. Gently shape FSL to desired form while damp
3. **Optional**: Pin edges to towel to maintain shape during drying
4. Allow to air dry completely (6-24 hours depending on climate)
5. **Optional**: Use fan to speed drying

### Step 7: Final Shaping (3D Designs)

For 3D bows, butterflies, or dimensional elements:

1. After FSL is completely dry, shape into 3D form
2. May require folding, bending, or pinching
3. Steam iron can be used to set final shape (use low heat, hover above FSL)
4. Some 3D designs require multiple FSL pieces assembled with hand stitching or glue

## Machine Settings

- **Needle**: Sharp embroidery needle (75/11 or 80/12)
- **Thread tension**: Slightly tighter than normal (creates denser stitch structure)
- **Speed**: Medium to slow (high stitch density may cause skipped stitches at high speed)
- **Stabilizer**: Water-soluble only (no tearaway or cutaway)

## What Not to Change

**DO NOT**:
- Resize FSL designs (alters stitch density and structural integrity)
- Use "reduce stitches" or "optimize" functions (FSL requires exact stitch density to be self-supporting)
- Substitute tearaway or cutaway stabilizer for water-soluble (FSL will not separate from stabilizer)
- Skip layers of stabilizer (FSL will be flimsy or distorted)

## Stabilizer Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Stabilizer won't dissolve | Wrong stabilizer type used | Verify water-soluble stabilizer (not tearaway or cutaway) |
| Stabilizer leaves sticky residue | Incomplete rinsing | Continue rinsing in fresh water until no residue remains |
| FSL feels stiff after drying | Stabilizer residue remains | Re-rinse FSL thoroughly; use warm water |
| FSL distorted or wavy after drying | FSL was pulled or stretched while wet | Handle gently; reshape and pin flat while drying |

## Common Problems and Causes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| FSL tears or falls apart during rinsing | Insufficient stitch density or thread breaks during stitching | Use original design file; check for skipped stitches before rinsing |
| FSL has holes or gaps | Stitch density was reduced or design was resized | Use design at original size without optimization |
| FSL won't hold shape | Insufficient stabilizer layers during stitching | Use 2-3 layers of stabilizer for most FSL |
| FSL puckers during stitching | Stabilizer not hooped taut | Re-hoop stabilizer with proper tension |
| Thread breaks frequently | Wrong needle, old thread, or too-tight tension | Use fresh sharp needle and quality thread; adjust tension |

## Storage and Care

### FSL Storage
- Store flat in page protectors or between tissue paper
- Avoid crushing or folding (creases are difficult to remove)
- Keep away from moisture (may attract mildew)

### Cleaning FSL Items
- Hand wash gently in cool water
- Lay flat to dry
- Do not machine wash or dry (FSL may tangle or distort)
- Re-shape while damp if needed

## 3D Design Assembly

Many 3D designs require multiple FSL pieces assembled together:

### Assembly Methods

1. **Hand stitching**: Use matching thread to stitch pieces together invisibly
2. **Fabric glue**: Thin layer of fabric glue or tacky glue (use sparingly)
3. **Hot glue**: For ornamental items (not washable after gluing)

### Assembly Tips

- Allow all FSL pieces to dry completely before assembly
- Shape pieces before assembly
- Use minimal glue (excess glue stiffens FSL)
- Let glued items cure fully (24 hours) before handling

## FSL Design Identification

FSL designs include these indicators:
- Design notes specify "Free-Standing Lace" or "FSL"
- Very high stitch count (creates dense, fabric-like structure)
- Designs have no fabric layer in preview
- Instructions mention water-soluble stabilizer

## Technical Notes

This guidance applies to pre-digitized FSL and 3D embroidery designs that create self-supporting structures from thread alone. Designs from Artapli are used as examples. FSL designs are digitized with precise stitch density and underlay structures—any modification to stitch count, density, or size destroys structural integrity. FSL requires water-soluble stabilizer; no substitutions produce successful results.

FSL technique allows creation of lace, ornaments, and dimensional designs without fabric backing. Success depends on proper stabilizer selection, complete stabilizer removal, and careful handling during wet stage.
