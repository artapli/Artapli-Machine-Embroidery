# Stitching Instructions: Fringe Embroidery Designs

> Technical guide for machine setup, stitch sequence, and finishing procedures for fringe embroidery designs

## Overview

This guide describes the stitch sequence and setup requirements for fringe embroidery designs. Fringe designs create a three-dimensional textured effect by cutting bobbin threads on the reverse side after stitching, causing top threads to form loops or tufts.

## Applicable Design Types

- Fringed appliqué designs
- Fringed fonts and lettering
- Fringed decorative elements (flowers, animals, borders)
- Fringed In-the-Hoop (ITH) projects
- Fringed Free-Standing Lace (FSL)

## Required Materials

### Thread
- **Recommended**: Polyester embroidery thread
- **Not recommended**: Rayon or silk thread (less durable when cut)

### Tools
- Small, sharp embroidery scissors with curved blades
- **Recommended brands**:
  - Kai 4-inch Curved Needlecraft Scissors
  - Fiskars Curved Craft Scissors

### Stabilizer
- Standard stabilizer appropriate for base fabric
- No special stabilizer requirements for fringe technique

## Stitch Sequence

### Step 1: Load and Stitch the Design

1. Hoop fabric with appropriate stabilizer
2. Load the fringe design file into your machine
3. Stitch the design completely as normal
4. **Important**: Long satin stitches will appear loose during stitching—this is correct behavior

### Step 2: Identify Fringe Areas

Fringe designs contain rows of long satin column stitches. These stitches run parallel and create the areas that will become fringe after cutting.

### Step 3: Cut Bobbin Threads (Reverse Side)

1. Remove fabric from hoop (or turn hoop over if still hooped)
2. Examine the reverse side of the embroidery
3. Locate the bobbin threads running along the long satin stitches
4. Using small, sharp scissors, cut the bobbin thread along each satin column
5. Work systematically through all fringe areas
6. If bobbin thread is not visible, cut conservatively in small increments

**Note**: If bobbin thread visibility is poor, you may adjust bobbin tension slightly looser for future projects.

### Step 4: Fluff the Fringe (Front Side)

1. Turn fabric to front side
2. Using the tip of small scissors or fingers, gently fluff and separate the cut threads
3. The fringe will form loops (if bobbin thread was cut precisely) or open-ended tufts (if top threads were also trimmed)

## Machine Settings

- **Needle**: Standard sharp embroidery needle (75/11 or 80/12)
- **Thread tension**: Normal
- **Bobbin tension**: Standard, or slightly looser if bobbin threads need to be more visible for cutting

## What Not to Change

**DO NOT**:
- Resize fringe designs (alters stitch length and density, destroying fringe effect)
- Use "reduce stitches" or "optimize" functions in software (removes long satin columns required for fringe)
- Convert between formats with auto-optimization enabled

## Looped vs. Open-Ended Fringe

- **Looped fringe**: Cut only bobbin thread precisely along the bobbin line. Top threads remain looped.
- **Open-ended fringe**: Cut through both bobbin and top threads. Creates bushier, more textured effect.

Both styles are acceptable. Open-ended fringe occurs naturally if bobbin thread is not visible during cutting.

## Common Problems and Causes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Fringe is uneven or sparse | Design was resized or optimized | Use original design file without modification |
| Cannot see bobbin threads to cut | Bobbin tension too tight | Loosen bobbin tension slightly or cut conservatively by estimation |
| Top threads pull out when cutting | Using rayon or silk thread | Use polyester thread for better durability |
| Fringe looks flat after cutting | Did not fluff threads | Gently separate and fluff threads with scissors tip or fingers |
| Base fabric was cut during bobbin trimming | Scissors too sharp or cutting too aggressively | Use curved scissors and cut conservatively in small increments |

## Video Demonstrations

## Technical Notes

This guidance applies to pre-digitized embroidery designs that rely on stitch sequencing and density control. Designs from Artapli are used as examples. The fringe technique depends on long satin stitches digitized at specific densities—modifications to stitch count, length, or sequence will destroy the fringe effect.
