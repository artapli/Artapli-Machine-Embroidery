# Stitching Instructions: In-the-Hoop (ITH) Projects

> Technical guide for multi-step sequencing, fabric tacking, and assembly procedures for ITH embroidery

## Overview

This guide describes the stitch sequence and setup requirements for In-the-Hoop (ITH) embroidery projects. ITH designs construct complete projects entirely within the embroidery hoop through precise multi-step stitching sequences. Projects are assembled, lined, and finished without removing from the hoop until final step.

## Applicable Design Types

- ITH zippered bags and pouches
- ITH keychains and key fobs
- ITH towel toppers and holders
- ITH ornaments and decorations
- ITH stuffed items (pillows, sachets)
- ITH bookmarks and tags
- ITH coasters and trivets

## Required Materials

### Fabrics

| Material | Purpose | Specifications |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Main fabric** | Outer visible layer | Medium-weight cotton, canvas, or decorator fabric |
| **Lining fabric** | Inner layer | Quilting cotton or lightweight fabric |
| **Backing fabric** | Support layer | Muslin or same as main fabric |

Fabric quantities vary by project size—consult design instructions for exact measurements.

### Notions

- **Zippers**: For zippered ITH projects (usually 1-2" longer than project width)
- **Ribbons/cords**: For loops, tabs, or handles (typically 4-6" lengths)
- **Elastic**: For certain holder designs
- **Buttons, snaps, or closures**: Per design requirements

### Stabilizer

- **Type**: Medium to heavy-weight tearaway
- **Reason**: ITH designs stitch multiple fabric layers and require strong support
- **Quantity**: 1-2 layers depending on design density

### Securing Materials

- **Clear tape** or masking tape (for securing fabrics and zippers)
- **Temporary spray adhesive** (optional, for fabric positioning)
- **Pins** (use outside stitching area only)

### Tools

- Sharp fabric scissors
- Seam ripper (for error correction)
- Turning tool or chopstick (for turning projects right-side-out)
- Hand-sewing needle and thread (for closing turning openings)

## General ITH Stitch Sequence

While specific steps vary by project, most ITH designs follow this pattern:

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

1. Hoop stabilizer only (no fabric)
2. First stitches create reference lines or outlines on stabilizer
3. These guide fabric placement for subsequent steps

### Phase 2: Component Placement and Tacking

1. Position components (zippers, ribbons, backing fabric) on stabilizer following stitch guides
2. Secure with tape (tape outside stitching areas)
3. Tack-down seams stitch to attach components
4. **Critical**: Do NOT unhoop between steps
5. May require pausing machine to add or fold fabrics

### Phase 3: Main Fabric Addition

1. Place main fabric pieces following placement stitches
2. Fabric may be placed right-side-up or right-side-down depending on project type
3. Tack-down seams secure main fabric
4. May require folding fabric after tacking (creates finished edges)

### Phase 4: Decorative Elements

1. Embroidered designs, lettering, or decorative stitches
2. Applied while fabrics are flat and accessible
3. This step may occur earlier or later depending on design structure

### Phase 5: Lining Addition

1. Remove hoop from machine (do NOT unhoop project)
2. Turn hoop over to access reverse side
3. Place lining fabric on back, covering entire project
4. Secure with tape
5. Reattach hoop to machine

### Phase 6: Final Outline

1. Final seam stitches around project perimeter
2. Joins all layers together
3. Creates cutting line for project shape
4. May include small opening for turning (if project requires turning)

### Phase 7: Finishing

1. Remove from hoop
2. Tear away excess stabilizer
3. Cut out project following final stitched outline
4. Clip corners and curves (if applicable)
5. Turn right-side-out through zipper or designated opening
6. Close any turning openings with hand stitching (ladder stitch)
7. Press and finish

## ITH Zippered Bag Sequence (Detailed Example)

This sequence applies to most ITH zippered pouches and bags:

### Step 1: Zipper Placement Line
- Stitches reference line on stabilizer only
- Shows where zipper will be positioned

### Step 2: Position Zipper
- Center zipper over placement line
- Zipper extends beyond project edges (trimmed later)
- Tape zipper securely, keeping zipper pull outside stitching area

### Step 3: Zipper Tack-Down
- Stitches along both sides of zipper
- Secures zipper to stabilizer

### Step 4: Add Front Main Fabric (Below Zipper)
- Place main fabric right-side-down, edge aligned with lower zipper tack line
- Covers zipper by approximately 0.5"
- Tape in place

### Step 5: Front Fabric Tack-Down
- Stitches seam joining front fabric to zipper
- Stop machine after tack-down

### Step 6: Fold Front Fabric Down
- Fold front fabric downward, right-side-up
- Fabric now covers lower half of project
- **Important**: Do NOT unhoop

### Step 7: Front Fabric Securing Seam
- Stitches lower outline to hold fabric flat
- May include decorative elements at this stage

### Step 8: Add Front Lining (Below Zipper)
- Turn hoop over
- Place lining fabric on back, right-side-down
- Align edge with upper zipper line
- Tape in place

### Step 9: Lining Tack-Down
- Stitches lining to zipper from back side

### Step 10: Add Back Main Fabric (Above Zipper)
- Place back fabric right-side-up (or folded edge)
- Covers upper zipper area
- Tape securely

### Step 11: Back Fabric Tack-Down
- Stitches along folded edge to hide zipper

### Step 12: Unzip Zipper Halfway
- **Critical**: Open zipper before final stitching
- If zipper is closed, project cannot be turned right-side-out

### Step 13: Add Back Lining
- Turn hoop over
- Place lining fabric covering entire back
- Tape edges

### Step 14: Final Outline Stitch
- Stitches complete perimeter
- Joins all layers
- Creates cutting line

### Step 15: Finishing
- Remove from hoop, trim stabilizer
- Cut out along outline
- Clip corners
- Turn through zipper opening
- Close bottom lining opening with hand stitching

## Critical ITH Rules

### Never Unhoop
- **Most important rule**: Do NOT unhoop project until design is completely finished
- Registration between layers depends on hoop maintaining position
- Unhooping destroys alignment

### Pause, Don't Unhoop
- If you must examine project, pause machine and remove hoop from machine
- Keep fabric in hoop
- Return same hoop to machine

### Tape Positioning
- Always tape outside stitching areas
- Remove tape before stitching over taped areas (if possible)
- Clear tape works best (can see through it)

### Zipper Management
- Always position zipper pull outside stitching area (tape it down)
- Never stitch through zipper pull or metal stops
- Always open zipper halfway before final seam (for turning)

## Machine Settings

- **Needle**: Sharp embroidery needle (75/11 or 80/12)
- **Thread tension**: Normal
- **Speed**: Medium (allows time to pause for fabric additions)
- **Presser foot pressure**: Normal to slightly increased

## What Not to Change

**DO NOT**:
- Resize ITH designs (destroys alignment between layers)
- Skip color stops (each stop represents a fabric addition step)
- Rearrange stitch sequence (sequence is carefully engineered)
- Unhoop project until completely finished
- Use "reduce stitches" or "optimize" functions

## Fabric Cutting Guidelines

Most ITH designs require fabrics cut to specific sizes:

- **Main fabric front**: Usually smaller piece
- **Main fabric back**: Usually larger piece (extends beyond front)
- **Lining fabrics**: Cut slightly larger than finished project dimensions
- **Backing fabric**: Cut with generous excess (trimmed after stitching)

Always cut fabrics slightly oversized rather than undersized—excess can be trimmed.

## Common Problems and Causes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Layers misaligned | Project was unhooped between steps | Never unhoop until design complete |
| Cannot turn project right-side-out | Zipper was left closed during final stitching | Always open zipper halfway before final seam |
| Zipper stitched through metal parts | Zipper pull not secured outside stitching area | Tape zipper pull firmly; position it well outside stitch area |
| Fabric shifts during stitching | Insufficient taping or adhesive | Use generous tape; ensure fabrics are flat and secure |
| Layers pucker | Insufficient stabilizer | Use heavy-weight tearaway stabilizer; may need 2 layers |
| Project shape distorted after removing from hoop | Hoop was too tight | Hoop stabilizer taut but not stretched; fabric adds bulk |
| Thread nests on back | Too many fabric layers for needle | Use fresh sharp needle; check bobbin tension |

## Turning Opening Options

### Zippered Projects
- Turn through zipper opening (no separate turning opening needed)
- Zipper must be partially open before final seam

### Non-Zippered Projects
- Design includes small opening in final seam
- Opening is typically 2-3" along straight edge
- Close opening with hand stitching (ladder stitch) after turning

## Hand Stitching Techniques

### Ladder Stitch (Invisible Stitch)
- Used to close turning openings
- Alternates between folded edges
- Creates invisible seam when pulled tight
- Secure with several backstitches at end

## Technical Notes

This guidance applies to pre-digitized ITH embroidery designs that rely on precise multi-step sequencing. Designs from Artapli are used as examples. ITH designs are engineered with exact layer alignment, tack-down positions, and turning openings—any modification to sequence, sizing, or stitch order will result in misaligned layers or unusable projects.

ITH projects are complex and require following instructions precisely. Each color stop represents a specific action (pause to add fabric, fold fabric, turn hoop over, etc.). Always review complete project instructions before beginning.
