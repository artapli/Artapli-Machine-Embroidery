# Stitching Instructions: Appliqué Embroidery Designs

> Technical guide for appliqué fabric placement, tack-down sequences, and finishing procedures

## Overview

This guide describes the stitch sequence and setup requirements for appliqué embroidery designs. Appliqué combines fabric pieces with embroidery stitching, creating layered designs where fabric is tacked down and finished with satin stitch borders.

## Applicable Design Types

- Standard appliqué designs (single or multiple fabrics)
- Reverse appliqué
- Ribbon appliqué
- Layered appliqué
- Appliqué combined with other techniques (fringe, 3D elements)

## Required Materials

### Appliqué Fabric
- **Weight**: Light to medium-weight cotton, felt, or specialty fabrics
- **Type**: Woven fabrics preferred for clean edges
- **Preparation**: Cut pieces slightly larger than placement area (will be trimmed after tacking)
- **Optional**: Heat-activated fusible backing (for fabric stability)

### Securing Methods
- **Temporary spray adhesive** (505, KK100, or similar)
- **Masking tape** or painter's tape
- **Pins** (use with caution—may interfere with stitching)
- **Double-sided fabric tape** (for slippery fabrics)

### Thread
- Standard polyester embroidery thread
- Satin stitch borders typically match appliqué fabric color

### Stabilizer
- **Type**: Medium-weight cutaway or tearaway
- **Reason**: Appliqué adds fabric layers, increasing stitch density

### Tools
- Sharp fabric scissors or rotary cutter
- Small embroidery scissors for detail trimming

## Stitch Sequence

Appliqué designs follow a specific multi-step sequence. Each color stop represents a stage in the process.

### Step 1: Placement Outline

1. Hoop base fabric with appropriate stabilizer
2. Load appliqué design file
3. Machine stitches placement outline (usually first color)
4. **Purpose**: Placement outline shows exactly where appliqué fabric should be positioned
5. **Important**: This is a light running stitch or narrow satin—NOT the final border

### Step 2: Position Appliqué Fabric

1. **Stop machine after placement outline completes**
2. **Do NOT unhoop project**
3. Place appliqué fabric over placement outline
4. Fabric should cover entire placement area with excess around edges (approximately 0.5" excess)
5. Secure fabric using one of these methods:
   - Spray temporary adhesive on reverse side of appliqué fabric, press onto base fabric
   - Tape edges of appliqué fabric to base fabric (tape outside placement area)
   - Use pins outside stitching area (remove before stitching resumes)

**Safety Warning**: Never hold fabric with hands while machine is running.

### Step 3: Tack-Down Seam

1. Resume stitching
2. Machine stitches tack-down seam (usually second color)
3. **Purpose**: Secures appliqué fabric to base fabric
4. Tack-down is typically a narrow straight stitch or narrow zigzag running just inside the placement line
5. **Stop machine after tack-down completes**
6. **Do NOT unhoop project**

### Step 4: Trim Excess Appliqué Fabric

1. Using sharp scissors, carefully trim excess appliqué fabric close to tack-down seam
2. Leave approximately 1-2mm of fabric beyond tack-down stitch
3. **Critical**: Do NOT cut through base fabric or stabilizer
4. Trim conservatively—satin stitch border will cover raw edges
5. Remove any tape or pins

### Step 5: Satin Stitch Border (Final Step)

1. Resume stitching
2. Machine stitches satin stitch border (usually third color)
3. **Purpose**: Covers raw edges of appliqué fabric and creates finished border
4. Satin stitch is dense zigzag that encapsulates fabric edges
5. Design is complete after satin stitch

## Multiple Appliqué Pieces

For designs with multiple appliqué fabrics, the sequence repeats for each fabric:

1. Placement outline #1
2. Position fabric #1
3. Tack-down #1
4. Trim fabric #1
5. Satin stitch #1
6. Placement outline #2
7. Position fabric #2
8. (continue sequence for each appliqué piece)

## Ribbon Appliqué Variation

Ribbon appliqué uses grosgrain or satin ribbon instead of fabric pieces:

1. Placement outline stitches
2. Fold and position ribbon to fill shape (may require multiple ribbon pieces)
3. Tape ribbon securely in place
4. Tack-down seam stitches
5. Trim any excess ribbon ends
6. Satin stitch border completes design

Ribbon does not fray, so trimming is less critical than with fabric.

## Machine Settings

- **Needle**: Sharp embroidery needle (75/11 or 80/12)
- **Thread tension**: Normal
- **Speed**: Medium (slower speed allows better control during tack-down steps)
- **Presser foot pressure**: Normal to slightly increased (holds fabric layers flat)

## What Not to Change

**DO NOT**:
- Resize appliqué designs (placement outlines, tack-down seams, and satin borders must align precisely)
- Use "reduce stitches" or "optimize" functions (destroys multi-step sequencing)
- Skip placement outline (causes fabric misalignment)
- Unhoop project between steps (registration will be lost)
- Convert between formats with auto-optimization enabled

## Fabric Selection Guidelines

| Fabric Type | Recommended | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Cotton (quilting weight)** | ✓ Yes | Ideal—clean edges, easy to trim, no stretch |
| **Felt** | ✓ Yes | Does not fray, very forgiving, no raw edges |
| **Flannel** | ✓ Yes | Soft finish, minimal fraying |
| **Satin/Silk** | △ Caution | Frays easily, slippery, requires fusible backing |
| **Knits** | ✗ Avoid | Stretches during trimming, curls at edges |
| **Heavy canvas** | △ Caution | Difficult to trim cleanly, may cause needle deflection |

## Common Problems and Causes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Appliqué fabric shifts during tack-down | Insufficient securing | Use temporary adhesive spray, not just pins or tape |
| Raw fabric edges visible after satin stitch | Trimmed too close to tack-down seam | Leave 1-2mm fabric beyond tack-down; satin stitch should fully cover edges |
| Base fabric cut during trimming | Cutting too aggressively | Use sharp scissors and trim conservatively; feel for fabric layers |
| Appliqué fabric puckers | Insufficient stabilizer | Use medium-weight cutaway stabilizer for appliqué designs |
| Satin stitch does not align with tack-down | Project was unhooped between steps | Never unhoop until design is complete |
| Fabric frays excessively during trimming | Fabric type frays easily | Use felt, fuse fabric backing, or choose tighter-weave fabrics |
| Needle breaks during satin stitch | Too many fabric layers or dull needle | Use fresh sharp needle; check fabric layer count |

## Fusible Backing for Appliqué Fabrics

For fabrics that fray, stretch, or are difficult to handle:

1. Iron fusible interfacing or appliqué backing to reverse side of appliqué fabric before cutting
2. Follow fusible product instructions for heat and timing
3. Fusible backing stabilizes fabric and reduces fraying
4. Particularly useful for satin, silk, or lightweight fabrics

## Technical Notes

This guidance applies to pre-digitized appliqué embroidery designs that rely on precise stitch sequencing. Designs from Artapli are used as examples. Appliqué designs are digitized with exact alignment between placement outlines, tack-down seams, and satin borders—any modification to stitch sequence, position, or size will destroy registration.

## Appliqué Design Identification

Appliqué designs typically include these indicators:
- Multiple color stops (minimum 3: placement, tack-down, satin)
- Design notes or color chart indicating "appliqué fabric placement"
- Light running stitch or narrow satin as first color (placement outline)
- Final color is always dense satin stitch border
