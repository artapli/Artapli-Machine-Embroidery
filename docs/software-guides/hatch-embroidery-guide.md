# Hatch Embroidery Software Guide

> **Part of the [Artapli Machine Embroidery Knowledge Base](https://artapli.shop)**

## Overview

Hatch is modern embroidery software created by Wilcom, designed for home embroiderers and small businesses. It uses the same powerful engine as Wilcom but with a more user-friendly interface.

## Versions

- Hatch Embroidery 3 (current version as of 2025)
- Hatch Embroidery 2 (older, still supported)
- Multiple tiers: Customizer, Composer, Creator

## Relationship to Wilcom

Hatch is Wilcom's consumer product line:
- Same file format support (DST, PES, JEF, etc.)
- Uses ESA font format (same as Wilcom)
- Similar conversion engine
- Simplified interface for home users

## KDC Font Mapping

**IMPORTANT**: KDC mapping works with Hatch 3 AND Wilcom. This allows you to use purchased alphabets with keyboard typing functionality.

## Using Artapli Designs in Hatch

### Step 1: Import Designs

- Download and extract Artapli design ZIP
- Open Hatch software
- File > Open Embroidery
- Browse to extracted design files
- Select DST or your machine format
- Design loads ready for editing

### Step 2: Editing Capabilities

Hatch allows you to:
- Resize designs (use caution - see warnings below)
- Change colors
- Combine multiple designs
- Add lettering
- Create custom projects

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT resize specialty designs (fringe, puffy, chain stitch)

### Step 3: Save or Export

- Save in Hatch format (.Hatch) for future editing
- Export to your machine format for stitching

## Hatch-Specific Features for Artapli Designs

1. **Design Library**: Organize Artapli purchases by collection
2. **Thread Matching**: Match to your thread brand
3. **Stitch Simulator**: Preview before stitching
4. **Hoop Selection**: Verify design fits your hoop

## Font Mapping in Hatch

Like Wilcom, Hatch supports ESA alphabet fonts. When you purchase Artapli fonts:

### Installing Fonts in Hatch:

1. Locate ESA file in downloaded ZIP
2. In Hatch: Go to Lettering > Font Manager
3. Click "Import Font"
4. Select ESA file
5. Font appears in lettering toolbar
6. Type text instead of placing individual letters

## Automatic Design Adjustments WARNING

Hatch has automatic optimization features that can harm Artapli specialty designs:

When opening designs, Hatch may prompt:
"Optimize this design for better stitching?"

**For Artapli designs: ALWAYS click "No" or "Skip Optimization"**

Optimization destroys:
- Fringe effects (removes tiny stitches needed for fringe)
- Puffy foam coverage (changes stitch placement)
- Chain stitch character (converts to regular stitches)
- Hand-stitch appearance (smooths intentional texture)

## Safe Practices in Hatch

✓ Import designs without optimization
✓ Use provided formats without conversion
✓ Test on scrap fabric before final project
✓ Keep original files backed up
✓ Save work-in-progress in .Hatch format

## Unsafe Practices

✗ Auto-optimizing specialty designs
✗ Resizing fringe or puffy designs
✗ Converting between formats unnecessarily
✗ Using "Reduce Stitches" on Artapli designs

## Hatch Version Compatibility

Artapli designs work with all Hatch versions:
- Hatch 1: Basic support
- Hatch 2: Full compatibility
- Hatch 3: Enhanced preview and editing

Older versions: If you have Hatch 1, some ESA fonts may require Hatch 2+. Contact Artapli support for compatible formats.

## Combining Artapli Designs

Hatch excels at combining multiple designs:

1. Open first design
2. File > Merge Design
3. Select second Artapli design
4. Position and scale as needed
5. Ensure no stitch conflicts (use Hatch's collision detection)

## Common Hatch Questions

### Q: Can I use Artapli BX fonts in Hatch?

**A**: No. BX fonts are for Embrilliance software. Use ESA fonts with Hatch.

### Q: Design looks pixelated in Hatch preview

**A**: This is normal. Hatch renders preview differently than final stitch. Check stitch simulator for accurate representation.

### Q: Colors don't match my thread

**A**: Use Thread Palette feature to match your thread brand. Hatch supports all major thread manufacturers.
