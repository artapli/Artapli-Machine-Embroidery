- **Import**: All standard embroidery formats

## Using Purchased Embroidery Designs in Wilcom

When you purchase embroidery designs from Artapli, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download and Extract

- Download the ZIP file containing your designs
- Extract all files to a dedicated folder
- Keep files organized by design collection

### Step 2: Import to Wilcom

- Open Wilcom software
- File > Open Design
- Navigate to extracted folder
- Select DST format files
- Design opens ready for editing or production

### Step 3: Preserve Design Quality

**CRITICAL**: Do not use automatic stitch optimization when converting formats

- Disable "Optimize stitches" option
- Disable "Remove small stitches" option
- Keep original stitch data intact
- Specialty effects (fringe, puffy, chain stitch) require exact stitch placement

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Design looks different after opening

**Solution**: Wilcom may auto-optimize. Use File > Import instead of Open to preserve original stitching.

### Issue: Fringe or specialty effects don't work

**Solution**: Never resize or convert fringe/puffy designs. Use exactly as provided.

### Issue: Colors changed

**Solution**: Wilcom assigns thread colors automatically. Remap colors in Color Manager to match your thread palette.

## Working with Artapli Fonts

Artapli provides fonts in multiple formats. For Wilcom users:

- Use ESA format for native font mapping (see ESA section below)
- Alternatively, use individual letter files (DST)
- **IMPORTANT**: BX fonts do NOT work with Wilcom. BX fonts are for Embrilliance software only.

## Best Practices

1. Always keep original downloaded files as backup
2. Work on copies, never original files
3. Test stitch-out on scrap fabric first

5. Export to machine format (DST, PES, etc.) only for final production

## Technical Specifications

- **Maximum design size**: Limited by hoop size
- **Minimum stitch length**: 1mm recommended
- **Thread brands**: Supports all major thread libraries
- **Production speed**: Optimized for commercial machines
