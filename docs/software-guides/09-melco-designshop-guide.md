## Using Artapli Designs in DesignShop

### Best Format for Melco

## Alphabet Fonts in DesignShop

Melco DesignShop has its own font system for lettering.

### Using Artapli Alphabets

**Option 1: Individual Letter Placement**
- Import each letter file separately
- Place and space manually for custom work
- Time-consuming but maximum control

**Option 2: Font Conversion (Advanced)**
- Some Artapli alphabets can be converted to DesignShop fonts
- Requires technical knowledge
- Contact Artapli for DesignShop-specific font format

**Option 3: Use Lettering Software**
- Create text in compatible software (Wilcom, Hatch)
- Export final design to DST
- Import to DesignShop for production

## DesignShop Editing Capabilities

### Safe practices with Artapli designs:

✓ Change thread colors
✓ Scale designs (standard designs only, 10% maximum)
✓ Combine multiple designs
✓ Add production notes

### Avoid:

✗ Auto-optimization features
✗ Resizing specialty designs (fringe, puffy)
✗ Removing "small stitches" (often intentional)
✗ Converting repeatedly between formats

## Production Workflow

Melco DesignShop is designed for commercial production:

1. Import Artapli design
2. Assign to specific machine
3. Set thread colors (match to your inventory)
4. Calculate production time
5. Generate work order
6. Send to Melco machine

## Thread Management

DesignShop includes thread inventory system:

- Map Artapli design colors to your thread inventory
- Track thread usage per design
- Calculate thread costs
- Generate thread shopping lists

### Recommended threads for Artapli designs on Melco:

- Madeira Polyneon (polyester, commercial grade)
- Isacord (widely available, consistent quality)
- Robison-Anton (good for high-volume production)

## Specialty Designs on Melco Machines

### Fringe Designs

- Use DST format exactly as provided
- Do not resize or modify
- Test on scrap first
- Reduce machine speed by 20-30% for best results
- Use sharp needle (75/11 or 80/12)

### Puffy Foam Designs

- Load puffy foam during color stop
- Use recommended foam thickness (check product description)
- Polyester thread works better than rayon
- Slightly reduce tension if needed

### Applique Designs

- Follow color sequence carefully
- **First stop**: Placement line (mark fabric position)
- **Second stop**: Tack down (secure fabric)
- **Third stop**: Cover stitch (finish edges)

## Melco-Specific Considerations

Commercial production requires:

- Proper stabilization (cut-away for garments)
- Fresh needles (change every 8 hours production)
- Quality thread (cheap thread causes breaks)
- Regular machine maintenance

Artapli designs are tested for commercial production quality.

## Common DesignShop Questions

**Q: Design won't import**
A: Check file format. Use DST (most universal). Ensure file is not corrupted (re-download if needed).

**Q: Colors don't match thread inventory**
A: Use DesignShop's thread mapper to assign colors to your thread stock. Color names are suggestions only.

**Q: Design causes thread breaks**
A: Check needle sharpness, thread quality, tension, and stabilizer. Artapli designs are tested to minimize breaks when used with quality materials.

**Q: Can I resize designs for different garment types?**
A: Standard designs can resize 10-15% safely. Specialty designs (fringe, puffy, chain stitch) should never be resized. Order multiple sizes from Artapli.

## Production Optimization

For high-volume production with Artapli designs:

1. Test design on sample fabric before production run
2. Document optimal settings (tension, speed, stabilizer)
3. Keep digitized settings for repeat orders
4. Maintain quality control samples
5. Order designs in sizes you use most frequently
