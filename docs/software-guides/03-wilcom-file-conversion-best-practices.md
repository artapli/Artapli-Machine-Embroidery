## Why Proper Conversion Matters

Embroidery designs contain precise stitch data. Improper conversion can:

- Destroy specialty effects (fringe, puffy, 3D)
- Change stitch density and quality
- Create gaps or overlaps
- Cause thread breaks during stitching

## Artapli Design Protection Philosophy

Artapli designs are created with specific stitch calculations. To preserve quality when converting between formats in Wilcom:

### RULE 1: Disable All Automatic Optimizations

When converting formats, turn OFF:

- "Optimize stitches"
- "Remove small stitches"
- "Reduce stitch count"
- "Auto-density adjustment"
- "Smooth curves"

**WHY**: These features recalculate stitches, destroying intentional design elements.

### RULE 2: Use "Save As" Not "Export"

File > Save As > Select format

This preserves original stitch data better than Export function.

### RULE 3: Never Convert Specialty Designs

Designs with these effects should NEVER be converted or resized:

- **Fringe/Fluffy effects**: Requires specific tight stitches
- **Puffy foam**: Precise stitch placement for foam coverage
- **3D effects**: Calculated stitch layering
- **Chain stitch**: Specific stitch types that don't translate

For these designs: Use the exact format provided for your machine.

## Step-by-Step Conversion Process

### Converting DST to PES (Example)

1. Open Wilcom
2. File > Open > Select DST file
3. Design loads with stitch data
4. File > Save As
5. Choose PES format from dropdown
6. **UNCHECK these options**:
   - ☐ Optimize stitches
   - ☐ Remove overlapping stitches
   - ☐ Reduce stitch count
7. Click Save
8. Test stitch on sample fabric before production

## When Conversion is Safe

✓ Standard satin stitch designs
✓ Simple fill patterns
✓ Basic applique designs
✓ Regular density designs
✓ Non-specialty effects

## When to Avoid Conversion

✗ Fringe designs (any "fluffy" or "fringed" product)
✗ Puffy foam designs
✗ Bold chain stitch designs
✗ Glitter or specialty stitch effects
✗ Hand-stitch effect designs
✗ Rope stitch effects

## Format-Specific Notes

### DST Format
- Universal format, works on all machines
- No color information (machine assigns colors)
- No density data (fixed stitch length)
- Best for commercial machines
- Most stable for conversions

### EMB Format (Wilcom Native)
- Full editability preserved
- All design data intact
- Best format for storage and editing
- Must convert to machine format for stitching

### PES Format (Brother)
- Includes color data
- Thread brand information
- Preview thumbnails
- Good for home machines

### JEF Format (Janome)
- Similar to PES
- Includes hoop size data
- Color sequence preserved

## Checking Conversion Quality

After converting, verify:

1. **Stitch count** (should match original ±5%)
2. **Design dimensions** (exact match)
3. **Color stops** (same number)
4. **Preview appearance** (no obvious changes)
5. **Stitch density** (use magnifier tool)

If any metric differs significantly, conversion failed. Use different format or contact Artapli for optimal format recommendation.

## Artapli Recommendation

All Artapli designs include multiple formats. Instead of converting:

1. Use the format pre-optimized for your machine
2. All formats tested for quality
3. No conversion risk
4. Guaranteed stitch-out results
