# Hatch Font Mapping for Purchased Alphabets

> **Part of the [Artapli Machine Embroidery Knowledge Base](https://artapli.shop)**

---

## Overview

Hatch 2 and Hatch 3 include font mapping capability, allowing you to type text with purchased alphabet designs instead of placing letters individually.

## KDC Font Mapping Support

**IMPORTANT**: KDC mapping works with Hatch 3 AND Wilcom. This powerful feature allows keyboard typing with your purchased alphabets.

## Requirements

- Hatch Embroidery 2 or newer (Hatch 1 does not support font mapping)
- Purchased alphabet in ESA format
- Basic understanding of Hatch lettering tools

## What is Font Mapping

Font mapping converts individual embroidery letter files into a "keyboard font" where:
- You type letters on keyboard
- Letters appear automatically with proper spacing
- Baseline alignment is automatic
- Editing text is instant (no repositioning each letter)

## Benefits

### Before font mapping:
- Place each letter individually
- Manually adjust spacing between letters
- Realign if text changes
- Time-consuming for long words

### After font mapping:
- Type complete words or sentences
- Software handles spacing
- Edit text instantly
- Modify size, spacing with sliders

## Using Artapli ESA Fonts in Hatch

### Step 1: Verify ESA Format

Check your Artapli purchase includes ESA format:
- Product description states "ESA format included"
- Downloaded ZIP contains .ESA file
- If not included, contact Artapli for ESA version

### Step 2: Import Font to Hatch

1. Open Hatch Embroidery
2. Click "Lettering" tab
3. Click "Font Manager" button
4. Click "Import" or "Add Font"
5. Navigate to downloaded ESA file
6. Select ESA file and click Open
7. Font name appears in font list

### Step 3: Use Mapped Font

1. Select "Text" tool from Lettering toolbar
2. Find your imported Artapli font in font dropdown
3. Type your desired text
4. Font renders with proper spacing
5. Adjust size, letter spacing, baseline as needed

## Creating Custom Font Mapping (Advanced)

If your Artapli alphabet doesn't include ESA, you can create mapping in Hatch 3:

### Manual Font Mapping Process:

1. Import all individual letter files (A-Z, 0-9, punctuation)
2. Lettering > Font Manager > Create New Font
3. Assign each letter file to corresponding keyboard key
4. Set default spacing (left/right bearing for each letter)
5. Define baseline position
6. Save as custom font
7. Font now available for typing

This is advanced and time-consuming. Artapli recommends:
- Use provided ESA fonts when available
- Request custom ESA format from Artapli support
- Or continue using individual letter placement

## Font Mapping Settings

After importing font, customize:
- **Default size** (small, medium, large presets)
- **Letter spacing** (percentage adjustment)
- **Baseline position** (for special effects)
- **Kerning pairs** (adjust space between specific letter combinations)

## Specialty Artapli Fonts

### Fringe Fonts:
- Never resize after typing
- Use exact size provided
- Spacing adjustment is safe
- Resizing destroys fringe effect

### Puffy Fonts:
- Designed for specific foam heights
- Resizing changes foam coverage
- Use original size or contact Artapli for different sizes

### Applique Fonts:
- Include placement and cover stitches
- Color stops indicate applique fabric placement
- Follow color sequence carefully

## Troubleshooting Font Mapping

### Issue: Font import fails

**Solution**: Check Hatch version (must be 2 or newer). Verify ESA file is not corrupted (re-download if needed).

### Issue: Letters overlap when typed

**Solution**: Adjust letter spacing in Font Properties. Some fonts need wider spacing.

### Issue: Baseline is uneven

**Solution**: Check baseline settings in Font Manager. Some fonts have intentional baseline variation (script fonts).

### Issue: Missing characters

**Solution**: Check which characters are included. Some Artapli specialty fonts only include uppercase or specific character sets. See product description.

## Comparing Typing vs. Individual Letters

### Typed text (mapped font):
✓ Faster creation
✓ Easy editing
✓ Consistent spacing
✓ Professional baseline
✗ Less control over individual letter placement
✗ Limited to included characters

### Individual letters:
✓ Complete creative control
✓ Custom spacing per letter
✓ Monogramming flexibility
✗ Time-consuming
✗ Manual spacing adjustment
✗ Difficult to edit

Choose method based on project needs.

## Best Practices

1. Test font on scrap fabric before production
2. Save project in Hatch format (.EMBX) to preserve editability
3. Keep original ESA files backed up
4. Document custom spacing settings for consistent results
5. Create project templates for frequently used text layouts
