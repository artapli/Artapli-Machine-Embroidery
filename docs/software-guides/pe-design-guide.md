## Overview

PE-Design is Brother's official embroidery software for creating and editing
designs for Brother and Babylock embroidery machines.


## Current Versions

- PE-Design 12 (current as of 2026)
- PE-Design 11 (widely used)
- PE-Design 10 and earlier (older versions)


## File Formats

- Native: PED (PE-Design project format)
- Machine: PES (Brother/Babylock machine format)
- Import: All standard embroidery formats (DST, JEF, HUS, etc.)


## Using Artapli Designs In Pe-Design



### Recommended Format:

- PES format (Brother native)
- All Artapli designs include PES
- Optimized for Brother machines
- Includes color data and proper sequencing


### Importing Designs:

1. Download Artapli design ZIP
2. Extract files
3. Open PE-Design
4. File > Open
5. Select PES file (or DST if PES not available)
6. Design opens ready for editing or export


## Alphabet Fonts In Pe-Design

PE-Design has its own font system different from ESA (Wilcom) or BX (Embrilliance).

PE-Design Font Format: PES Alphabet
Some Artapli alphabets include PE-Design compatible format. Check product
description for "PE-Design alphabet format included."


### Installing Alphabets in PE-Design 11:

1. Locate alphabet folder in Artapli download
2. PE-Design > Settings > Font Settings
3. Add font folder location
4. Font appears in lettering palette
5. Type text with automatic spacing

Using Individual Letters (when PE-Design format not included):
1. Open first letter file (A.PES)
2. Edit > Combine
3. Open next letter (B.PES)
4. Position manually
5. Repeat for all letters in word
6. Save combined design

Manual process is time-consuming. Artapli recommends requesting PE-Design
alphabet format if not included with purchase.


## Pe-Design Editing Features


### Safe editing for Artapli designs:

✓ Change thread colors
✓ Combine multiple designs
✓ Add monograms or text
✓ Resize standard designs (10-15% maximum)
✓ Rotate or mirror


### Unsafe editing:

✗ Using "Optimize Stitches" on specialty designs
✗ Resizing fringe or puffy designs beyond provided sizes
✗ Converting between formats repeatedly
✗ Reducing stitch count on dense designs


## Specialty Design Handling


### Artapli specialty effects in PE-Design:



### Fringe Designs:

- Import as PES or DST
- Do NOT use PE-Design's stitch editor
- Do NOT resize
- Stitch exactly as provided


### Puffy Foam Designs:

- Use PES format
- Check color sequence (first color is usually outline/placement)
- Do not edit stitch density
- Use recommended foam thickness (usually 2-3mm)


### Applique Designs:

- Follow color stops carefully
- First color: Placement line
- Second color: Tack-down (stop and place fabric)
- Third color: Cover stitch
- PE-Design shows color sequence in design properties


## Pe-Design Version Compatibility


### Artapli PES files work with:

- PE-Design 12: Full compatibility
- PE-Design 11: Full compatibility
- PE-Design 10: Compatible (some features may differ)
- PE-Design 6-9: Basic compatibility

Older versions: If using PE-Design 6-9, some newer PES features may not display
correctly. Use DST format as fallback.


## Brother Machine Compatibility


### PE-Design creates designs for:

- Brother PR/Entrepreneur series (commercial)
- Brother Stellaire series
- Brother Innov-is series
- Babylock embroidery machines (BLM, ENT, etc.)

All Artapli PES files are tested on Brother machines for quality assurance.


## Common Pe-Design Questions



### Q: Design won't open in PE-Design

**A: Check file format. PE-Design prefers PES. If using DST, some color information**

may be lost. Try right-click > Open With > PE-Design.


### Q: How do I change design colors?

**A: Select design > Edit > Color Sequence > Click color to change > Choose new**

thread color from palette.


### Q: Can I combine multiple Artapli designs?

**A: Yes. Open first design, then Edit > Combine > Open second design. Position**

as needed. Check stitch sequence to avoid conflicts.


### Q: Design is too big for my hoop

**A: Check Artapli product page for multiple sizes. Download appropriate size.**

If minor adjustment needed, resize 10% maximum for standard designs. Never
resize specialty effects.


## Converting Designs In Pe-Design


### PE-Design can convert between formats:

- File > Output > Select format
- For Artapli designs: Disable optimization
- Keep original stitch data intact
- See Wilcom conversion guide for best practices (same principles apply)


## Pe-Design Project Workflow

1. Import Artapli design (PES recommended)
2. Customize if needed (colors, combinations)
3. Save as PED format for future editing
4. Export to PES for Brother machine
5. Transfer to USB
6. Load on embroidery machine


## Thread Libraries In Pe-Design


### PE-Design supports multiple thread brands:

- Brother embroidery thread (default)
- Madeira
