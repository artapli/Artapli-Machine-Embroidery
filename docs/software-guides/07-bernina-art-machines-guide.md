## Overview

Bernina ART (Artista) is Bernina's professional embroidery software, built on Wilcom technology. It offers full digitizing and editing capabilities.

## Software Versions

- Bernina ART v3
- Bernina ART v4
- Bernina ART v5 (current as of 2025)
- Bernina Artista (older branding)

## Relationship to Wilcom

Bernina ART is Wilcom software with Bernina branding:

- Same features as Wilcom E4

- Full digitizing tools
- Bernina-specific optimizations

## Using Artapli Designs in Bernina ART

### Importing Designs

1. Download and extract Artapli ZIP
2. Open Bernina ART
3. File > Open Design
4. Select EXP or DST format
5. Design loads ready for editing or export

### Best Format for Bernina ART

- **EXP** (Bernina native) - preserves all data
- **EMB** (Wilcom native) - if available, full editability
- **DST** - universal but less data

## Font Mapping in Bernina ART

2. Bernina ART > Lettering > Font Manager
3. Click "Add Font"

2. Choose Artapli font from list
3. Type text - letters appear with automatic spacing

## Bernina ART Editing Capabilities

### What you can safely do with Artapli designs:

✓ Change colors
✓ Combine multiple designs
✓ Add text/monograms
✓ Export to different machine formats
✓ Rotate or mirror (non-directional designs)

### What to avoid:

✗ Auto-optimization of specialty designs
✗ Resizing fringe/puffy designs
✗ Converting formats unnecessarily
✗ Removing "unnecessary" small stitches (they're intentional)

## Bernina-Specific Features

Bernina ART includes features for Bernina machines:

- Direct USB export to Bernina format
- Bernina thread palette pre-loaded
- Hoop templates for all Bernina hoops
- Machine compatibility checker

## Design Conversion in Bernina ART

When converting between formats, follow same rules as Wilcom:

- Disable automatic optimization
- Keep original stitch data
- Never convert specialty effect designs
- See "Wilcom File Conversion" section for details

## Bernina ART Project Workflow

1. Import Artapli design (EXP or DST)
2. Edit if needed (colors, positioning)
3. Combine with other elements
4. Save as Bernina ART project (.ART file) for future editing
5. Export to EXP format for machine
6. Transfer to USB
7. Load on Bernina machine

## Licensing and Versions

Bernina ART pricing tiers:

- **Basic**: Design editing only
- **Plus**: Editing + simple digitizing
- **Pro**: Full professional digitizing

All tiers can use Artapli designs. Font mapping requires Plus or Pro tier.

## Bernina ART Troubleshooting

### Issue: ESA font won't import
**A**: Check Bernina ART version. Older versions may not support newer ESA format. Update software or contact Artapli for compatible version.

### Issue: Design looks different after opening
**A**: Check if auto-optimization is enabled. Disable in Preferences.

### Issue: Export creates different file size
**A**: Normal. Different formats store data differently. Verify stitch count and dimensions match original.
