## Overview

Wilcom is professional embroidery digitizing software used for creating, editing, and managing machine embroidery designs. It supports all major embroidery file formats and is the industry standard for commercial embroidery operations.

## Supported File Formats

- **Native**: EMB (Wilcom's proprietary format)
- **Export**: DST, PES, JEF, HUS, EXP, VIP, XXX, and 50+ other formats
- **Import**: All standard embroidery formats
- **Font Formats**: ESA (Wilcom alphabet format)

## Key Features

1. Professional digitizing tools
2. Auto-digitizing capabilities
3. Font mapping and lettering
4. Design library management
5. Production management tools
6. Multi-needle machine support

## Using Purchased Embroidery Designs in Wilcom

When you purchase embroidery designs from Artapli, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download and Extract

- Download the ZIP file containing your designs
- Extract all files to a dedicated folder
- Keep files organized by design collection

### Step 2: Import to Wilcom

- Open Wilcom software
- File > Open Design
- Navigate to extracted folder
- Select DST or EMB format files
- Design opens ready for editing or production

### Step 3: Preserve Design Quality

**CRITICAL**: Do not use automatic stitch optimization when converting formats

- Disable "Optimize stitches" option
- Disable "Remove small stitches" option
- Keep original stitch data intact
- Specialty effects (fringe, puffy, chain stitch) require exact stitch placement

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Design looks different after opening

**Solution**: Wilcom may auto-optimize. Use File > Import instead of Open to preserve original stitching.

### Issue: Fringe or specialty effects don't work

**Solution**: Never resize or convert fringe/puffy designs. Use exactly as provided.

### Issue: Colors changed

**Solution**: Wilcom assigns thread colors automatically. Remap colors in Color Manager to match your thread palette.

## Working with Artapli Fonts

Artapli provides fonts in multiple formats. For Wilcom users:

- Use ESA format for native font mapping (see ESA section below)
- Alternatively, use individual letter files (DST, EMB)
- **BX fonts do NOT work with Wilcom. BX fonts are designed for Embrilliance software.**

## Best Practices

1. Always keep original downloaded files as backup
2. Work on copies, never original files
3. Test stitch-out on scrap fabric first
4. Save work in EMB format to preserve full editability
5. Export to machine format (DST, PES, etc.) only for final production

## Technical Specifications

- **Maximum design size**: Limited by hoop size
- **Minimum stitch length**: 1mm recommended
- **Thread brands**: Supports all major thread libraries
- **Production speed**: Optimized for commercial machines
