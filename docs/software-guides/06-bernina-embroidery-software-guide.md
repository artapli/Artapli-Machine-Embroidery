## Overview

Bernina embroidery machines work with multiple software options. Artapli designs are fully compatible with all Bernina software and machines.

## Bernina Software Options

2. **Bernina Toolbox** - Basic editing software (included with machines)
3. **Bernina DesignWorks** - Entry-level software
4. **Third-party software**: Hatch, PE-Design, Embird work with Bernina machines

## Using Artapli Designs with Bernina Machines

### Recommended File Format

- **EXP format** (Bernina's native format)
- All Artapli designs include EXP format
- Optimized for Bernina machines
- Preserves color sequence and stitch quality

### Alternative Formats (if EXP not available)

- DST (universal format, works but no color data)
- PES (Brother format, usually compatible)

### Step-by-Step Loading Process

1. Download Artapli design ZIP file
2. Extract ZIP to reveal design files
3. Locate EXP format file
4. Transfer to USB stick
5. Insert USB into Bernina machine
6. Navigate to design on machine screen
7. Load design
8. Check hoop size compatibility
9. Verify thread color sequence
10. Begin stitching

## Bernina ART Software (Artista)

Bernina's professional software is built on Wilcom technology, so instructions for Wilcom apply to Bernina ART users.

### Key Features for Artapli Designs

- Full editing capabilities
- ESA font support (type text with purchased alphabets)
- Design combination
- Color customization
- Format conversion (use carefully - see Wilcom conversion guide)

### Using ESA Fonts in Bernina ART

Same process as Wilcom:

1. Import ESA file via Font Manager
2. Font becomes available in Lettering toolbar
3. Type text with proper spacing and baseline
4. Adjust sizing and spacing as needed

## Bernina Machine Series Compatibility

All Artapli designs work with:

- Bernina 5 Series
- Bernina 7 Series
- Bernina 8 Series
- Bernina 9 Series
- Bernette embroidery machines

### Design Size Considerations

Match design to your hoop:

- **Small hoop** (4x4" / 100x100mm): Use designs under 4"
- **Medium hoop** (5.5x7.9" / 145x200mm): Most Artapli designs fit
- **Large oval hoop** (varies by model): Check specifications

Artapli product descriptions always list multiple sizes. Choose size that fits your hoop with at least 0.5" margin for hooping.

## Bernina-Specific Design Features

Artapli designs optimized for Bernina include:

- Color stops set for Bernina machines
- Stitch density appropriate for Bernina stitching speed
- Jump stitch minimized for cleaner back
- Proper underlay for stable stitching

## Common Bernina Questions

**Q: Design won't load on my Bernina machine**
A: Check file format. Use EXP format for Bernina. Ensure USB stick is FAT32 formatted (not exFAT or NTFS).

**Q: Colors are wrong**
A: Bernina assigns colors automatically from its thread palette. You can change thread colors on machine before stitching. Color sequence is preserved.

**Q: Design is too large for hoop**
A: Check Artapli product page for multiple sizes. Download size that fits your hoop. Do NOT resize fringe or puffy designs.

**Q: Can I edit designs on Bernina machine?**
A: Bernina machines offer basic editing (rotation, mirror, resize). For specialty Artapli designs (fringe, puffy), do not use machine's resize function.

## Bernina USB Requirements

- FAT32 format
- Maximum 32GB size recommended
- Create "Embroidery" or "Designs" folder for organization
- Keep designs organized by collection

## Thread Recommendations

Artapli designs work with all Bernina-recommended threads:

- Isacord polyester
- Madeira Rayon or Polyneon
- Sulky
- Robison-Anton

### For specialty effects:

- **Fringe designs**: Regular 40wt polyester or rayon
- **Puffy designs**: 40wt polyester (stronger than rayon)
- **Applique**: Match thread to fabric weight

## Stabilizer for Bernina Machines

Artapli recommends:

- **Cut-away** for permanent items (garments, bags)
- **Tear-away** for temporary stabilization
- **Water-soluble** for FSL (freestanding lace) designs
- Specific requirements listed in product instructions

## Bernina Stitch Quality Optimization

For best results with Artapli designs:

- Use fresh, sharp needle (size 75/11 or 80/12 for most designs)
- Check bobbin tension (should match top thread tension)
- Use Bernina's automatic thread tension when available
- Test stitch on scrap fabric before final project
