## Overview

Embird is affordable embroidery software for Windows, popular among home
embroiderers for editing and managing designs. Known for reliability and
comprehensive format support.


## Software Modules

- Embird Basic: Viewing, editing, cataloging
- Embird Studio: Digitizing module
- Embird Font Engine: Advanced lettering
- Various plugins for special features


## File Formats

- Native: None (works directly with machine formats)
- Supported: Over 70 embroidery formats including all major brands
- Font: Embird Font Objects (.EOF)


## Using Artapli Designs In Embird



### Importing Designs:

1. Download Artapli ZIP and extract
2. Open Embird Editor
3. File > Open
4. Select any format (DST, PES, JEF, EXP, etc.)
5. Design loads ready for editing


### Recommended Format:

- DST (universal compatibility)
- Your machine's native format (PES for Brother, JEF for Janome, etc.)
- Embird reads all formats equally well


## Embird Editing Capabilities


### Safe edits for Artapli designs:

✓ Change thread colors
✓ Resize designs (standard designs, 10-15% maximum)
✓ Rotate and mirror
✓ Combine multiple designs
✓ Export to different formats


### Avoid:

✗ Using "Remove Small Stitches" on specialty designs
✗ Auto-density adjustments
✗ Resizing fringe or puffy designs
✗ Aggressive optimization


## Alphabet Fonts In Embird

Embird Font Engine allows typing with alphabet designs.


### Using Artapli Alphabets:


### If Artapli alphabet includes Embird format (.EOF):

1. Copy .EOF file to Embird's font folder
2. Restart Embird
3. Font appears in Font Engine
4. Type text with automatic spacing


### If Embird format not included:

1. Import individual letter files
2. Place manually
3. Or request .EOF format from Artapli support


### Creating Embird Font from Letters (Advanced):

Embird Font Engine allows creating fonts from individual letters:
1. Import all letter files
2. Font Engine > Create New Font
3. Assign each letter to keyboard character
4. Set spacing and baseline
5. Save as .EOF file
This is time-consuming. Use provided formats when available.


## Embird Catalog


### Embird includes powerful cataloging system:

- Organize Artapli purchases by collection
- View thumbnails
- Search by keyword
- Quick access to frequently used designs


### Setting up Artapli Catalog:

1. Create folder for Artapli designs
2. Organize by product/collection
3. Embird Catalog > Add Folder
4. Catalog generates thumbnails automatically
5. Search and insert designs quickly


## Embird Format Conversion


### Embird excels at format conversion:

- File > Save As > Choose format
- For Artapli designs: Use "Write without modification" option
- Preserves original stitch data
- No automatic optimization


### Safe conversion practices:

✓ Convert standard designs between formats
✓ Use batch conversion for multiple files
✓ Keep originals backed up


### Unsafe practices:

✗ Converting specialty designs (fringe, puffy)
✗ Using "Optimize" during conversion
✗ Converting between formats repeatedly (degradation)


## Specialty Designs In Embird



### Fringe Designs:

- Open in Embird without modification
- Do NOT resize
- Do NOT use density tools
- Stitch as-is for proper fringe effect


### Puffy Foam Designs:

- Import directly
- Check color sequence
- First color usually placement/outline
- Do not modify stitch structure


### Applique Designs:

- Color sequence is critical
- First: Placement line
- Second: Tack-down (place fabric during this stop)
- Third: Cover/satin stitch


## Embird Iconizer

Unique Embird feature: Iconizer creates thread color previews
- Automatically generates realistic preview
- Shows actual thread colors
- Helps plan thread changes
- Visual reference for color matching


### Use Iconizer with Artapli designs to:

- Preview final appearance
- Match thread brands to your inventory
- Plan color substitutions


## Embird Cross Stitch Module

Some Embird versions include cross-stitch conversion.
Note: Artapli designs are machine embroidery, not cross-stitch patterns.
Do not convert Artapli designs to cross-stitch.


## Technical Specifications

- Platform: Windows only
- Maximum design size: Limited by machine format
- Thread brands: All major brands supported
- File limit: No practical limit


## Common Embird Questions



### Q: Design file won't open

**A: Embird reads almost all formats. If file won't open, it may be corrupted.**

Re-download from Artapli. Ensure file has correct extension (.dst, .pes, etc.).


### Q: How do I change thread brands?

**A: Tools > Thread Palette > Select your thread brand. Embird remaps all colors**

to closest match in your brand.


### Q: Can I edit stitch types?

**A: Embird Editor allows stitch editing. For Artapli designs, avoid editing**

stitches unless you understand digitizing. Modifications can destroy effects.


### Q: Design is too large

**A: Check Artapli product page for multiple sizes. Download appropriate size.**

Minor resize (10%) is safe for standard designs, but not specialty designs.
