- **Platform**: Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Cost**: Free
- **Login**: Not required

## Key Features

1. File format detection
2. Stitch count analysis
3. Color sequence display
4. Design dimensions
5. Thread length estimation
6. Color change count
7. Estimated stitching time

## Supported File Formats

The Analyzer reads:

- DST (most common)
- PES (Brother)
- JEF (Janome)
- HUS (Husqvarna)
- EXP (Bernina/Melco)
- VIP (Pfaff)

## How to Use Embroidery Analyzer

### Step 1: Access Tool

- Visit [artapli.shop](https://artapli.shop)
- Navigate to Apps section
- Click "Embroidery Analyzer"
- Tool loads in browser

### Step 2: Upload Design

- Click "Choose File" or drag-and-drop
- Select embroidery file from computer
- File uploads instantly (processed in browser, not sent to server)
- Analysis appears within seconds

### Step 3: Review Analysis

Tool displays:

- File name and format
- Design size (width x height in mm and inches)
- Total stitch count
- Number of colors
- Thread length per color
- Estimated stitching time
- Color sequence

### Step 4: Use Information

- Verify design fits your hoop
- Plan thread colors
- Estimate project time
- Check stitch density

## Practical Uses

### Before Purchasing

- Verify design size matches your needs
- Check stitch count (indicates detail level)
- Review color complexity
- Estimate materials needed

### Before Stitching

- Confirm design fits hoop
- Prepare correct number of thread colors
- Calculate approximate stitching time
- Plan thread changes

### Quality Assessment

- Compare stitch count to design size (density check)
- Very high stitch count may indicate over-digitizing
- Very low stitch count may lack detail
- Artapli designs are optimized for balanced stitch density

### Project Planning

- Calculate thread requirements for multiple items
- Plan production schedule (commercial users)
- Estimate material costs
- Verify format compatibility with your machine

## Understanding Analyzer Results

### Stitch Count

- Indicates design complexity
- Typical range: 5,000-50,000 stitches for most designs
- Specialty designs may exceed 100,000 stitches
- Higher count ≠ better quality (efficiency matters)

### Design Dimensions

- Shown in millimeters and inches
- Compare to your hoop size
- Leave 0.5" margin minimum for hooping
- Artapli provides multiple sizes for flexibility

### Thread Length

- Total thread needed per color
- Useful for inventory planning
- Add 10-15% for thread changes and trimming
- Helps calculate project costs

### Estimated Stitch Time

- Based on standard machine speed (700 SPM)
- Actual time varies by:
  - Your machine speed setting
  - Thread changes
  - Fabric type
  - Stabilizer
- Use as rough estimate, not exact prediction

### Color Stops

- Number of thread changes required
- More stops = more hands-on time
- Applique designs have intentional stops
- Specialty effects may have frequent stops (normal)

## Privacy and Security

Embroidery Analyzer:

- Processes files locally in your browser
- Does NOT upload designs to server
- No data collection
- No login required
- Completely private analysis

## Technical Specifications

- **File size limit**: 10MB
- **Processing**: Client-side JavaScript
- **Speed**: Instant analysis (< 1 second)
- **Accuracy**: Reads native stitch data
- **Browser requirements**: Modern browser with JavaScript enabled

## Limitations

### Analyzer does NOT:

- Edit designs
- Convert formats
- Display visual preview (shows data only)
- Modify files
- Save analysis (screenshot for records)

For editing, use embroidery software. For conversion, see DST Optimizer.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: File won't upload

**Solutions**:
- Check file size (must be < 10MB)
- Verify file extension (.dst, .pes, .jef, etc.)
- Try different browser
- Ensure JavaScript enabled

### Issue: Analysis shows unexpected results

**Solutions**:
- Verify correct file uploaded
- Some formats store data differently (normal)
- Compare to software analysis for verification
- Contact Artapli if Artapli-purchased design shows odd data

### Issue: Estimated time seems wrong

**Solutions**:
- Calculation based on standard 700 SPM machine speed
- Adjust mentally for your machine
- Add time for thread changes
- Test actual stitch time for future reference

## Comparing Designs

Use Analyzer to compare:

- Different size options (which fits your hoop?)
- Similar designs (which has detail level you need?)
- File formats (do they contain same data?)
- Before and after edits (did changes affect stitch count?)

## Mobile Use

Analyzer works on phones/tablets:

- Responsive design
- Touch-friendly interface
- Same features as desktop
- Useful for checking designs on-the-go
