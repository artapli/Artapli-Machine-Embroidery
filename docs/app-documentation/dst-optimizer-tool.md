## Overview

DST Optimizer is free web-based tool by Artapli for converting and optimizing DST embroidery files. Reduces file size and removes unnecessary jump stitches while preserving design quality.

## Purpose

DST files from some sources contain:

- Excessive jump stitches
- Long trim commands
- Unnecessary color changes
- Bloated file size

DST Optimizer cleans these issues for smoother stitching.

## Access

- **URL**: [artapli.shop/pages/dst-optimizer](https://artapli.shop/pages/dst-optimizer)
- **Platform**: Web browser
- **Cost**: Free
- **No registration required**

## Key Features

1. Remove long jump stitches
2. Optimize trim commands
3. Reduce file size
4. Preserve design integrity
5. Batch processing
6. Preview before/after statistics

## When to Use DST Optimizer

### Use for:

✓ DST files that cause thread breaks from long jumps
✓ Designs with excessive trim commands
✓ Files that stitch slowly due to inefficient pathing
✓ DST files that need format conversion

### Do NOT use for:

✗ Specialty Artapli designs (already optimized)
✗ Designs where jump stitches are intentional
✗ Files in perfect working condition
✗ Non-DST formats (tool is DST-specific)

## How to Use DST Optimizer

### Step 1: Upload DST File

- Visit DST Optimizer page
- Click "Choose File"
- Select DST file from computer
- File uploads for processing

### Step 2: Choose Optimization Level

**Options**:

- **Light**: Removes only excessive jumps (safest)
- **Medium**: Balances optimization and safety (recommended)
- **Aggressive**: Maximum optimization (use carefully)

For Artapli designs or unknown sources: Use Light or Medium

### Step 3: Process

- Click "Optimize"
- Tool analyzes DST file
- Optimization happens in seconds
- Results display before/after statistics

### Step 4: Review Results

Tool shows:

- Original stitch count
- Optimized stitch count
- Stitches removed
- File size reduction
- Estimated time savings

### Step 5: Download

- Click "Download Optimized DST"
- Save to computer
- Test on scrap fabric before production
- Keep original file as backup

## Optimization Levels Explained

### Light Optimization

- Removes jumps > 10mm
- Preserves all design elements
- Safest option
- Minimal risk
- **Best for**: First-time use, important projects

### Medium Optimization (Recommended)

- Removes jumps > 7mm
- Reduces excessive trims
- Balances efficiency and safety
- Suitable for most designs
- **Best for**: General use, tested designs

### Aggressive Optimization

- Removes jumps > 5mm
- Maximum trim reduction
- Significant file size reduction
- Higher risk of altering design
- **Best for**: Problematic files, experienced users who will test first

## Technical Details

### What Gets Removed

- Long jump stitches between sections
- Redundant trim commands
- Excessive color changes (if same color)
- Unnecessary path optimization

### What Gets Preserved

- All visible stitches
- Design shape and size
- Stitch density
- Intentional color stops
- Specialty stitch types

### Algorithm

- Analyzes stitch-by-stitch
- Identifies inefficient jumps
- Calculates optimal path
- Removes safe-to-remove elements
- Rebuilds DST with same visual result

## When Optimization Helps

**Problem**: Commercial machine creates long thread tails
**Solution**: DST Optimizer removes excessive jumps causing tails

**Problem**: Design has too many trim commands (machine pauses frequently)
**Solution**: Optimizer consolidates trims

**Problem**: DST file is unusually large (slow to load)
**Solution**: Optimization reduces file size 20-50%

**Problem**: Design from unknown source stitches poorly
**Solution**: Clean up inefficient pathing

## Artapli Designs and Optimization

**Note**: Artapli designs are pre-optimized during creation

- Already have efficient pathing
- Jump stitches are intentional and minimal
- No need to optimize Artapli DST files
- Use optimizer for DST files from other sources

## Why DST Format

DST is universal format but:

- No embedded optimization data
- Different digitizers use different standards
- Machine settings vary
- Optimizer standardizes for best results

## Safety Considerations

### Always:

✓ Keep original file before optimizing
✓ Test optimized file on scrap first
✓ Start with Light optimization
✓ Compare visual appearance after optimization
✓ Document settings that work for your machine

### Never:

✗ Optimize without testing first
✗ Use Aggressive mode without experience
✗ Optimize specialty designs (fringe, puffy) - use original
✗ Optimize multiple times (degrades quality)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Optimized file looks different

**Solution**: Use lighter optimization level. Some jumps may be intentional. Return to original file.

### Issue: Design stitches poorly after optimization

**Solution**: Original had intentional jumps for fabric relief. Use original or try Light optimization only.

### Issue: File won't process

**Solution**: Check file is valid DST format. Try different browser. Verify file not corrupted.

### Issue: No improvement in file size

**Solution**: File was already optimized. No action needed.

## Batch Processing

For multiple files:

- Process one at a time
- Document settings used
- Test first file before batch-processing others
- Keep consistent optimization level for similar designs

## Mobile Compatibility

DST Optimizer works on:

- Smartphones
- Tablets
- Desktop computers
- Any device with modern browser

## Privacy

- Files processed locally in browser
- No upload to server
- No data collection
- Completely private
