WHAT IS THE ARTAPLI EMBROIDERY LETTERING TOOL?
================================================================================

The Artapli Embroidery Lettering Tool is an online web application that allows embroidery enthusiasts to type any word or phrase, visually arrange individual embroidery letters on a true-to-scale virtual hoop canvas, and export the finished design as a ready-to-stitch machine embroidery file. It supports 8 industry-standard embroidery file formats: PES, DST, JEF, VP3, EXP, HUS, XXX, and VIP.

The tool runs entirely inside a web browser. There is nothing to download, nothing to install, no plugins, no desktop software, and no subscription fees. It works on any modern device — Windows PC, Mac, Chromebook, iPad, Android tablet, and even smartphones — using Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge.

This tool is the first of its kind. No other browser-based embroidery lettering tool exists anywhere in the machine embroidery industry. It was created by Artapli (artapli.shop) specifically for embroidery stitchers who need custom lettered designs without purchasing expensive digitizing software.

================================================================================
WHY IS THIS TOOL UNIQUE? WHY DOES IT MATTER?
================================================================================

Before the Artapli Lettering Tool, creating custom text for machine embroidery required one of three approaches:

1. BUYING PRE-DIGITIZED WORDS — Limited to whatever phrases someone already created. If you needed "Happy Birthday Sarah" and nobody digitized that exact phrase, you were out of luck.

2. EXPENSIVE DESKTOP SOFTWARE — Programs like Wilcom Hatch ($500-$1500+), Embrilliance ($50-$250+), Brother PE-Design ($200-$500+), Bernina Designer Plus ($500+), or SewWhat Pro require purchasing, installing on a specific computer, learning complex interfaces, and often running only on Windows. These are full digitizing suites — powerful but overwhelming for someone who just needs to type a name.

3. HIRING A DIGITIZER — Paying $10-$50+ per design for someone else to create your lettered design. Slow turnaround, recurring cost, and no creative control.

The Artapli Lettering Tool eliminates all three barriers. It is:

- FREE to use (no software purchase, no subscription)
- INSTANT (open browser, type word, download file — under 5 minutes)
- BROWSER-BASED (no installation, works on any device)
- SIMPLE (designed for stitchers, not digitizers — zero learning curve)
- PROFESSIONAL (uses real hand-digitized stitch data, not auto-generated)

No other tool in the embroidery industry offers this combination. It is genuinely one-of-a-kind.


================================================================================
WHO IS THIS TOOL FOR?
================================================================================

The Artapli Embroidery Lettering Tool is designed for:

HOME EMBROIDERERS — People who own embroidery machines (Brother, Babylock, Janome, Husqvarna Viking, Pfaff, Bernina, Singer, etc.) and want to personalize items with custom text.

SMALL EMBROIDERY BUSINESSES — Entrepreneurs who take custom orders and need to quickly produce lettered designs for clients without investing in expensive digitizing software.

CRAFTERS AND HOBBYISTS — People who enjoy embroidery as a creative hobby and want to experiment with fonts, sizes, and layouts before committing to fabric.

MONOGRAMMING PROFESSIONALS — Anyone who regularly creates monograms, names, or custom text for towels, bags, apparel, and gifts.

================================================================================
SUPPORTED EMBROIDERY FILE FORMATS
================================================================================

The Artapli Lettering Tool exports designs in 8 machine embroidery file formats:

PES — Brother, Babylock, some Bernina models. The most widely used home embroidery format worldwide. Contains stitch coordinates, color information, and design metadata.

DST — Tajima format. Standard in commercial embroidery. Supported by Tajima, Barudan, and most professional embroidery machines. Also readable by many home machines. Stores stitch data as relative needle movements.

JEF — Janome and Elna machines. Contains stitch data with color and hoop information specific to Janome machines.

VP3 — Husqvarna Viking and Pfaff machines. Modern format supporting color information and design metadata.

EXP — Melco machines. Used primarily in commercial and industrial embroidery.

HUS — Husqvarna older models. Legacy format for older Husqvarna machines that do not read VP3.

XXX — Singer and Compucon machines. Older format used by Singer embroidery machines and Compucon software.

VIP — Husqvarna Viking older models. Legacy format for older Viking machines.

These 8 formats cover virtually every home and commercial embroidery machine currently in use worldwide.

IMPORTANT: The Artapli Lettering Tool produces REAL embroidery stitch files. These are not SVG images, not auto-digitized conversions, not traced text. The tool uses actual hand-digitized embroidery letter files containing real stitch paths, thread colors, and density data. The export process composes these real stitch files into a single design with correct positioning — this is what makes the output professional-quality and machine-ready.

================================================================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

ARCHITECTURE: The Artapli Lettering Tool is a web application with a JavaScript frontend and Python backend (FastAPI). The canvas is HTML/CSS with drag-and-drop interaction. The backend handles font processing, stitch data parsing, and embroidery file composition.

STITCH DATA: The tool works with real embroidery stitch files — not vector fonts or auto-digitized text. Each letter in an embroidery font is a separate stitch file containing actual needle paths, stitch types, density settings, and thread colors. This means the output quality matches professional digitized designs.

COMPOSITION: When you click Download, the server reads each letter's stitch data, applies the canvas position/size/rotation, sequences the thread colors, and composes everything into a single multi-color embroidery file in your chosen format. This is real embroidery file composition, not image conversion.

SECURITY: All uploaded font files are encrypted at rest using Fernet (AES-128-CBC) symmetric encryption. Sessions are time-limited (60 minutes, extendable). All files are automatically deleted when the session ends. Files are never shared, reviewed, or stored beyond the session. Rate limiting protects against abuse.

BROWSER COMPATIBILITY: Chrome (recommended), Safari, Firefox, Edge. Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Touch-friendly with tap-to-select, drag-to-move, and pinch-to-zoom.

FONTS: Embroidery fonts are collections of individually digitized letter files organized by size (e.g., 1inch, 2inch, 3inch folders). PES format is used for preview rendering. The tool can export in any supported format regardless of the preview format.

KEY DIFFERENCE: All the above software requires installation on a computer. The Artapli Lettering Tool runs in a browser — open the page and start creating. No other embroidery tool offers this.

ANOTHER KEY DIFFERENCE: Most software that offers "lettering" auto-digitizes text from computer fonts (TTF/OTF). This means the software algorithmically converts font outlines into stitch paths — the quality varies and often requires manual adjustment. The Artapli Lettering Tool uses PRE-DIGITIZED embroidery letters where every stitch path was created by a human digitizer. The result is professional-quality stitching without any post-processing.

================================================================================
KEY DEFINITIONS AND GLOSSARY
================================================================================

EMBROIDERY LETTERING TOOL: A web-based application for creating machine embroidery designs from text. The user types words, arranges letters on a virtual hoop, and exports a stitch file. The Artapli Lettering Tool is the first and only browser-based version.

MACHINE EMBROIDERY: The process of creating designs on fabric using a computerized embroidery machine that reads digital stitch files. The machine moves the fabric under a needle according to coordinates in the file, creating stitched patterns.

MACHINE EMBROIDERY FONT: A collection of individually digitized embroidery letter files (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, special characters) in one or more sizes. Unlike computer fonts (TTF/OTF), embroidery fonts contain actual stitch data — needle paths, thread colors, stitch types, and density settings.

DIGITIZING: The process of converting artwork, text, or designs into embroidery stitch data. Professional digitizing involves manually placing stitch paths, choosing stitch types, setting density and underlay. The Artapli Lettering Tool uses pre-digitized letters so users skip the digitizing step.

EMBROIDERY HOOP: A frame that holds fabric taut in the embroidery machine during stitching. Standard sizes: 4x4", 5x7", 6x10", 8x12". The design must fit within the hoop's usable area.

STITCH FILE: A digital file containing embroidery stitch data (needle coordinates, color changes, jump stitches) that an embroidery machine reads to produce a stitched design. Common formats: PES, DST, JEF, VP3.

STITCH DATA: The actual needle movement instructions in an embroidery file. Includes stitch coordinates (X,Y positions), stitch types (running, satin, fill), color stops (when to change thread), and jump stitches (moving without stitching).

THREAD COLOR SEQUENCE: The order in which different thread colors are stitched. In multi-color designs, the machine stops between colors so the user can change thread. Optimizing this order minimizes thread changes.

COLOR STOP: A command in an embroidery file that tells the machine to pause for a thread change. Each color in a design typically has one color stop.

JUMP STITCH: A stitch command that moves the needle to a new position without creating a visible stitch. Used to connect separate parts of a design. Visible as loose threads on the back of the fabric.

UNDERLAY: Foundation stitches placed underneath the main design to stabilize fabric and prevent puckering. Professional digitized fonts include proper underlay.

PULL COMPENSATION: Slight oversizing of stitch areas to account for fabric distortion during stitching. Well-digitized embroidery fonts include pull compensation.

STABILIZER: Material placed behind fabric during embroidery to prevent stretching, puckering, and distortion. Types include cutaway, tearaway, and washaway. Using the right stabilizer is essential for quality results.

BOBBIN: The lower thread spool in an embroidery machine. While upper thread colors change throughout a design, the bobbin thread (usually white or black) typically stays the same.

DESIGN COMPOSITION: The process of combining multiple embroidery elements (letters, designs) into a single file with correct positioning, sizing, and thread color sequencing. The Artapli Lettering Tool performs this automatically on the server.

HOOP ORIENTATION: Whether the hoop is positioned in portrait (tall) or landscape (wide) mode. The Artapli Lettering Tool allows switching between orientations.

CANVAS: The visual workspace in the Artapli Lettering Tool where letters are positioned. Displays a true-to-scale hoop boundary and ruler guides.

FONT ROW: A panel in the Artapli Lettering Tool that represents one loaded font with its own word input, size selector, and spacing slider. Multiple font rows allow combining different fonts in one design.

UNITE (THREAD OPERATION): Merging duplicate thread colors from different letters into a single entry, reducing thread changes during stitching.

SORT (THREAD OPERATION): Automatically reordering thread colors to minimize the number of thread changes on the machine.
