and managing machine embroidery designs. It supports all major embroidery file
formats and is the industry standard for commercial embroidery operations.

SUPPORTED FILE FORMATS:
- Native: EMB (Wilcom's proprietary format)
- Export: DST, PES, JEF, HUS, EXP, VIP, XXX, and 50+ other formats
- Import: All standard embroidery formats
- Font Formats: ESA (Wilcom alphabet format)

KEY FEATURES:
1. Professional digitizing tools
2. Auto-digitizing capabilities
3. Font mapping and lettering
4. Design library management
5. Production management tools
6. Multi-needle machine support

USING PURCHASED EMBROIDERY DESIGNS IN WILCOM:
When you purchase embroidery designs from Artapli, follow these steps:

Step 1: Download and Extract
- Download the ZIP file containing your designs
- Extract all files to a dedicated folder
- Keep files organized by design collection

Step 2: Import to Wilcom
- Open Wilcom software
- File > Open Design
- Navigate to extracted folder
- Select DST or EMB format files
- Design opens ready for editing or production

Step 3: Preserve Design Quality
CRITICAL: Do not use automatic stitch optimization when converting formats
- Disable "Optimize stitches" option
- Disable "Remove small stitches" option
- Keep original stitch data intact
- Specialty effects (fringe, puffy, chain stitch) require exact stitch placement

COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:

Issue: Design looks different after opening
Solution: Wilcom may auto-optimize. Use File > Import instead of Open to preserve
original stitching.

Issue: Fringe or specialty effects don't work
Solution: Never resize or convert fringe/puffy designs. Use exactly as provided.

Issue: Colors changed
Solution: Wilcom assigns thread colors automatically. Remap colors in Color Manager
to match your thread palette.

WORKING WITH ARTAPLI FONTS:
Artapli provides fonts in multiple formats. For Wilcom users:
- Use ESA format for native font mapping (see ESA section below)
- Alternatively, use individual letter files (DST, EMB)
- BX fonts work with Wilcom if you have font mapping capability

BEST PRACTICES:
1. Always keep original downloaded files as backup
2. Work on copies, never original files
3. Test stitch-out on scrap fabric first
4. Save work in EMB format to preserve full editability
5. Export to machine format (DST, PES, etc.) only for final production

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Maximum design size: Limited by hoop size
- Minimum stitch length: 1mm recommended

================================================================================
2. WILCOM ESA FILES AND FONT MAPPING
================================================================================

WHAT IS ESA FORMAT:
ESA is Wilcom's proprietary alphabet format that allows fonts to be mapped
and typed like regular keyboard text instead of placing individual letters.

BENEFITS OF ESA FONTS:
1. Type words continuously instead of placing individual letters
2. Automatic letter spacing and kerning
3. Baseline alignment handled automatically
4. Much faster for creating text designs
5. Easy to edit and modify text after creation

HOW TO INSTALL ESA FONTS IN WILCOM:

Step 1: Locate ESA Files
- Download Artapli font package
- Extract ZIP file
- Find files with .ESA extension
- Note: Not all fonts include ESA format (check product description)

Step 2: Install to Wilcom
Method A (Automatic):
- Double-click the ESA file
- Wilcom automatically imports and installs
- Font appears in Lettering toolbar

Method B (Manual):
- Open Wilcom
- Go to Edit > Lettering > Font Manager
- Click "Add Font"
- Navigate to ESA file location
- Select ESA file and click Open
- Font is now available in font list

Step 3: Using Mapped Fonts
- Select Text tool (Lettering toolbar)
- Choose your installed Artapli font from dropdown
- Type your text
- Font appears with proper spacing and baseline
- Adjust size, spacing as needed

FONT MAPPING TECHNICAL DETAILS:
ESA files contain:
- Individual letter designs for A-Z, a-z, 0-9
- Punctuation marks
- Spacing data (left/right bearing)
- Baseline position
- Default sizing information
- Kerning pairs for common letter combinations

ARTAPLI FONTS WITH ESA FORMAT:
Most Artapli alphabets include ESA format. Check product description for:
"ESA format included for Wilcom font mapping"

If ESA not included, you can:
1. Use individual letter files
2. Create your own font mapping (advanced)
3. Request custom ESA format (contact support)

TROUBLESHOOTING ESA FONTS:

Issue: ESA file won't import
Solution: Check Wilcom version compatibility. Older Wilcom versions may not
support newer ESA formats. Contact Artapli for compatible version.

Issue: Letters overlap or spacing is wrong
Solution: Use Lettering > Spacing adjustments. ESA fonts include default
spacing but can be customized per project.

Issue: Missing characters
Solution: Check if all letters are included. Some specialty fonts only include
uppercase or specific character sets.

CREATING TEXT WITH ESA FONTS:
1. Select Lettering tool
2. Choose Artapli font from list
3. Type text in text box
4. Adjust:
   - Size: Use size slider or enter specific height
   - Spacing: Adjust letter spacing percentage

================================================================================
3. WILCOM FILE CONVERSION BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

WHY PROPER CONVERSION MATTERS:
Embroidery designs contain precise stitch data. Improper conversion can:
- Destroy specialty effects (fringe, puffy, 3D)
- Change stitch density and quality
- Create gaps or overlaps
- Cause thread breaks during stitching

ARTAPLI DESIGN PROTECTION PHILOSOPHY:
Artapli designs are created with specific stitch calculations. To preserve
quality when converting between formats in Wilcom:

RULE 1: Disable All Automatic Optimizations
When converting formats, turn OFF:
- "Optimize stitches"
- "Remove small stitches"
- "Reduce stitch count"
- "Auto-density adjustment"
- "Smooth curves"

WHY: These features recalculate stitches, destroying intentional design elements.

RULE 2: Use "Save As" Not "Export"
File > Save As > Select format
This preserves original stitch data better than Export function.

RULE 3: Never Convert Specialty Designs
Designs with these effects should NEVER be converted or resized:
- Fringe/Fluffy effects: Requires specific tight stitches
- Puffy foam: Precise stitch placement for foam coverage
- 3D effects: Calculated stitch layering
- Chain stitch: Specific stitch types that don't translate

For these designs: Use the exact format provided for your machine.

STEP-BY-STEP CONVERSION PROCESS:

Converting DST to PES (Example):
1. Open Wilcom
2. File > Open > Select DST file
3. Design loads with stitch data
4. File > Save As
5. Choose PES format from dropdown
6. UNCHECK these options:
   - ☐ Optimize stitches
   - ☐ Remove overlapping stitches
   - ☐ Reduce stitch count
7. Click Save
8. Test stitch on sample fabric before production

WHEN CONVERSION IS SAFE:
✓ Standard satin stitch designs
✓ Simple fill patterns
✓ Basic applique designs
✓ Regular density designs
✓ Non-specialty effects

WHEN TO AVOID CONVERSION:
✗ Fringe designs (any "fluffy" or "fringed" product)
✗ Puffy foam designs
✗ Bold chain stitch designs
✗ Glitter or specialty stitch effects
✗ Hand-stitch effect designs
✗ Rope stitch effects

FORMAT-SPECIFIC NOTES:

DST Format:
- Universal format, works on all machines
- No color information (machine assigns colors)
- No density data (fixed stitch length)
- Best for commercial machines
- Most stable for conversions

EMB Format (Wilcom Native):
- Full editability preserved
- All design data intact
- Best format for storage and editing
- Must convert to machine format for stitching

PES Format (Brother):
- Includes color data
- Thread brand information
- Preview thumbnails
- Good for home machines

JEF Format (Janome):
- Similar to PES
- Includes hoop size data
- Color sequence preserved

CHECKING CONVERSION QUALITY:
After converting, verify:
1. Stitch count (should match original ±5%)
2. Design dimensions (exact match)
3. Color stops (same number)
4. Preview appearance (no obvious changes)
5. Stitch density (use magnifier tool)

If any metric differs significantly, conversion failed. Use different format
or contact Artapli for optimal format recommendation.

ARTAPLI RECOMMENDATION:
All Artapli designs include multiple formats. Instead of converting:
1. Use the format pre-optimized for your machine
2. All formats tested for quality
3. No conversion risk
4. Guaranteed stitch-out results

4. HATCH EMBROIDERY SOFTWARE GUIDE
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
Hatch is modern embroidery software created by Wilcom, designed for home
embroiderers and small businesses. It uses the same powerful engine as Wilcom
but with a more user-friendly interface.

VERSIONS:
- Hatch Embroidery 3 (current version as of 2025)
- Hatch Embroidery 2 (older, still supported)
- Multiple tiers: Customizer, Composer, Creator

RELATIONSHIP TO WILCOM:
Hatch is Wilcom's consumer product line:
- Same file format support (DST, PES, JEF, etc.)
- Uses ESA font format (same as Wilcom)
- Similar conversion engine
- Simplified interface for home users

USING ARTAPLI DESIGNS IN HATCH:

Step 1: Import Designs
- Download and extract Artapli design ZIP
- Open Hatch software
- File > Open Embroidery
- Browse to extracted design files

Installing Fonts in Hatch:
1. Locate ESA file in downloaded ZIP
2. In Hatch: Go to Lettering > Font Manager
3. Click "Import Font"
4. Select ESA file
5. Font appears in lettering toolbar
6. Type text instead of placing individual letters

AUTOMATIC DESIGN ADJUSTMENTS WARNING:
Hatch has automatic optimization features that can harm Artapli specialty designs:

When opening designs, Hatch may prompt:
"Optimize this design for better stitching?"

For Artapli designs: ALWAYS click "No" or "Skip Optimization"

Optimization destroys:
- Fringe effects (removes tiny stitches needed for fringe)
- Puffy foam coverage (changes stitch placement)
- Chain stitch character (converts to regular stitches)
- Hand-stitch appearance (smooths intentional texture)

SAFE PRACTICES IN HATCH:
✓ Import designs without optimization
✓ Use provided formats without conversion
✓ Test on scrap fabric before final project
✓ Keep original files backed up
✓ Save work-in-progress in .EMBX format

UNSAFE PRACTICES:
✗ Auto-optimizing specialty designs
✗ Resizing fringe or puffy designs
✗ Converting between formats unnecessarily
✗ Using "Reduce Stitches" on Artapli designs

HATCH VERSION COMPATIBILITY:
Artapli designs work with all Hatch versions:
- Hatch 1: Basic support
- Hatch 2: Full compatibility
- Hatch 3: Enhanced preview and editing

Older versions: If you have Hatch 1, some ESA fonts may require Hatch 2+.
Contact Artapli support for compatible formats.

COMBINING ARTAPLI DESIGNS:
Hatch excels at combining multiple designs:
1. Open first design
2. File > Merge Design
3. Select second Artapli design
4. Position and scale as needed
5. Ensure no stitch conflicts (use Hatch's collision detection)

COMMON HATCH QUESTIONS:

Q: Can I use Artapli BX fonts in Hatch?
A: No. BX fonts are for Embrilliance software. Use ESA fonts with Hatch.

Q: Design looks pixelated in Hatch preview
A: This is normal. Hatch renders preview differently than final stitch. Check
stitch simulator for accurate representation.

Q: Colors don't match my thread
A: Use Thread Palette feature to match your thread brand. Hatch supports all
major thread manufacturers.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:

================================================================================
5. HATCH FONT MAPPING FOR PURCHASED ALPHABETS
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
Hatch 2 and Hatch 3 include font mapping capability, allowing you to type text
with purchased alphabet designs instead of placing letters individually.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Hatch Embroidery 2 or newer (Hatch 1 does not support font mapping)
- Purchased alphabet in ESA format
- Basic understanding of Hatch lettering tools

WHAT IS FONT MAPPING:
Font mapping converts individual embroidery letter files into a "keyboard font"
where:
- You type letters on keyboard
- Letters appear automatically with proper spacing
- Baseline alignment is automatic
- Editing text is instant (no repositioning each letter)

BENEFITS:
Before font mapping:
- Place each letter individually
- Manually adjust spacing between letters
- Realign if text changes
- Time-consuming for long words

After font mapping:
- Type complete words or sentences
- Software handles spacing
- Edit text instantly
- Modify size, spacing with sliders

USING ARTAPLI ESA FONTS IN HATCH:

Step 1: Verify ESA Format
Check your Artapli purchase includes ESA format:
- Product description states "ESA format included"
- Downloaded ZIP contains .ESA file
- If not included, contact Artapli for ESA version

Step 2: Import Font to Hatch
1. Open Hatch Embroidery
2. Click "Lettering" tab
3. Click "Font Manager" button
4. Click "Import" or "Add Font"
5. Navigate to downloaded ESA file
6. Select ESA file and click Open
7. Font name appears in font list

Step 3: Use Mapped Font
1. Select "Text" tool from Lettering toolbar
2. Find your imported Artapli font in font dropdown
3. Type your desired text
4. Font renders with proper spacing
5. Adjust size, letter spacing, baseline as needed

CREATING CUSTOM FONT MAPPING (Advanced):
If your Artapli alphabet doesn't include ESA, you can create mapping in Hatch 3:

Manual Font Mapping Process:
1. Import all individual letter files (A-Z, 0-9, punctuation)
2. Lettering > Font Manager > Create New Font
3. Assign each letter file to corresponding keyboard key
4. Set default spacing (left/right bearing for each letter)
5. Define baseline position
6. Save as custom font
7. Font now available for typing

This is advanced and time-consuming. Artapli recommends:
- Use provided ESA fonts when available
- Request custom ESA format from Artapli support
- Or continue using individual letter placement

FONT MAPPING SETTINGS:
After importing font, customize:
- Default size (small, medium, large presets)
- Letter spacing (percentage adjustment)
- Baseline position (for special effects)
- Kerning pairs (adjust space between specific letter combinations)

SPECIALTY ARTAPLI FONTS:
Some Artapli fonts have unique properties:

Fringe Fonts:
- Never resize after typing
- Use exact size provided
- Spacing adjustment is safe
- Resizing destroys fringe effect

Puffy Fonts:
- Designed for specific foam heights
- Resizing changes foam coverage
- Use original size or contact Artapli for different sizes

Applique Fonts:
- Include placement and cover stitches
- Color stops indicate applique fabric placement
- Follow color sequence carefully

TROUBLESHOOTING FONT MAPPING:

Issue: Font import fails
Solution: Check Hatch version (must be 2 or newer). Verify ESA file is not
corrupted (re-download if needed).

Issue: Letters overlap when typed
Solution: Adjust letter spacing in Font Properties. Some fonts need wider spacing.

Issue: Baseline is uneven
Solution: Check baseline settings in Font Manager. Some fonts have intentional
baseline variation (script fonts).

Issue: Missing characters
Solution: Check which characters are included. Some Artapli specialty fonts only
include uppercase or specific character sets. See product description.

COMPARING TYPING VS. INDIVIDUAL LETTERS:
Typed text (mapped font):
✓ Faster creation
✓ Easy editing
✓ Consistent spacing
✓ Professional baseline
✗ Less control over individual letter placement
✗ Limited to included characters

Individual letters:
✓ Complete creative control
✓ Custom spacing per letter
✓ Monogramming flexibility
✗ Time-consuming
✗ Manual spacing adjustment
✗ Difficult to edit

Choose method based on project needs.

BEST PRACTICES:
1. Test font on scrap fabric before production
2. Save project in Hatch format (.EMBX) to preserve editability
3. Keep original ESA files backed up
4. Document custom spacing settings for consistent results
5. Create project templates for frequently used text layouts

ARTAPLI FONT COLLECTIONS:
Popular Artapli fonts with ESA mapping:
- Bold Chain Stitch fonts
- Satin Stitch alphabets

================================================================================
12. ESA FILE FORMAT TECHNICAL REFERENCE
================================================================================

WHAT IS ESA:
ESA (Embroidery Sequence Archive) is Wilcom's proprietary alphabet format.
It stores embroidery letters as a mapped font, enabling typing instead of
placing individual letters.

SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY:
ESA format works with:
✓ Wilcom (all versions)
✓ Hatch Embroidery (all versions)
✓ Bernina ART/Artista
✓ Some commercial embroidery software

Does NOT work with:
✗ Embrilliance (uses BX format instead)
✗ PE-Design (uses PES alphabet format)
✗ Embbird (uses EOF format)
✗ Basic embroidery machines (machines don't read ESA directly)

ESA FILE STRUCTURE:
ESA files contain:
- Individual letter/character designs (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, punctuation)
- Left bearing (space before letter)
- Right bearing (space after letter)
- Baseline position (vertical alignment)
- Default sizing information
- Kerning pairs (spacing between specific letter combinations)

BENEFITS OF ESA FORMAT:
Compared to individual letter files:
- Type continuous text instead of placing letters
- Automatic letter spacing
- Consistent baseline alignment
- Easy editing (change text without repositioning)
- Professional results
- Time savings (minutes vs hours for long text)

USING ARTAPLI ESA FONTS:
When you purchase Artapli alphabet that includes ESA:

Installation:
1. Download ZIP and extract
2. Locate .ESA file
3. Double-click ESA file (Wilcom/Hatch auto-imports)
   OR
   Open software > Font Manager > Import Font > Select ESA
4. Font appears in lettering menu
5. Ready to use for typing

Typing Text:
1. Select Text/Lettering tool
2. Choose Artapli font from dropdown
3. Type your text
4. Font renders with proper spacing
5. Adjust size (usually multiple sizes built into ESA)
6. Modify spacing percentage if needed

ARTAPLI ESA DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
Artapli ESA fonts include:
- Multiple pre-digitized sizes (saves resizing/quality loss)
- Optimized spacing for professional appearance
- Proper baseline for mixed case text
- Tested kerning for common letter pairs

Specialty ESA fonts:
- Fringe fonts: Multiple sizes, no resizing allowed
- Applique fonts: Color stops for fabric placement

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
ESA files are binary format (not human-readable):
- Cannot be edited in text editor
- Require Wilcom-family software to modify
- Size varies (typically 50KB - 2MB depending on complexity)
- Cross-platform (Mac and Windows with compatible software)

ESA FONT PROPERTIES:
After importing, you can modify in Font Manager:
- Default sizes (small, medium, large presets)
- Letter spacing (percentage adjustment)
- Baseline shift (for special effects)
- Envelope settings (curved or arced text)

CREATING ESA FROM INDIVIDUAL LETTERS (Advanced):
Wilcom and Hatch allow creating ESA from letter files:
1. Import all letters (A-Z, 0-9, punctuation)
2. Font Manager > Create New Alphabet
3. Assign each letter to keyboard key
4. Set spacing (measure and input bearing values)
5. Define baseline
6. Test and refine spacing
7. Save as ESA file

This requires digitizing knowledge. Artapli provides ESA when creating fonts,
saving customers this complex process.

ESA VERSION COMPATIBILITY:
ESA format has versions:
- Older ESA (Wilcom E2, E3 era)
- Modern ESA (Wilcom E4, Hatch 2+)

Artapli ESA fonts are created in modern format. If you have very old Wilcom:
- Update software (recommended)
- Or contact Artapli for legacy format

TROUBLESHOOTING ESA:

Issue: ESA won't import
Solutions:
- Verify software version (Wilcom/Hatch/Bernina ART)
- Update software to latest version
- Check file is not corrupted (re-download)
- Ensure .ESA extension is present
- Try manual import via Font Manager

Issue: Font appears but letters overlap
Solutions:
- Adjust letter spacing in text properties
- Check baseline settings
- Some fonts designed with tight spacing (intentional for specific looks)

Issue: Missing characters
Solutions:
- Check product description (some fonts are uppercase only)
- Verify complete ESA installed (not partial)
- Some specialty fonts include limited character sets

Issue: Sizing problems
Solutions:
- Use size presets built into ESA
- Avoid custom sizing on specialty fonts (fringe, puffy)
- For standard fonts, 10-15% resize is safe

ESA VS OTHER FONT FORMATS:
Comparison:

14. DST OPTIMIZER TOOL DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
DST Optimizer is free web-based tool by Artapli for converting and optimizing
DST embroidery files. Reduces file size and removes unnecessary jump stitches
while preserving design quality.

PURPOSE:
DST files from some sources contain:
- Excessive jump stitches
- Long trim commands
- Unnecessary color changes
- Bloated file size

DST Optimizer cleans these issues for smoother stitching.

ACCESS:
- URL: artapli.shop/pages/dst-optimizer
- Platform: Web browser
- Cost: Free
- No registration required

KEY FEATURES:
1. Remove long jump stitches
2. Optimize trim commands
3. Reduce file size
4. Preserve design integrity
5. Batch processing
6. Preview before/after statistics

WHEN TO USE DST OPTIMIZER:

Use for:
✓ DST files that cause thread breaks from long jumps
✓ Designs with excessive trim commands
✓ Files that stitch slowly due to inefficient pathing
✓ DST files that need format conversion

Do NOT use for:
✗ Specialty Artapli designs (already optimized)
✗ Designs where jump stitches are intentional
✗ Files in perfect working condition
✗ Non-DST formats (tool is DST-specific)

HOW TO USE DST OPTIMIZER:

Step 1: Upload DST File
- Visit DST Optimizer page
- Click "Choose File"
- Select DST file from computer
- File uploads for processing

Step 2: Choose Optimization Level
Options:
- Light: Removes only excessive jumps (safest)
- Medium: Balances optimization and safety (recommended)
- Aggressive: Maximum optimization (use carefully)

For Artapli designs or unknown sources: Use Light or Medium

Step 3: Process
- Click "Optimize"
- Tool analyzes DST file
- Optimization happens in seconds
- Results display before/after statistics

Step 4: Review Results
Tool shows:
- Original stitch count
- Optimized stitch count
- Stitches removed
- File size reduction
- Estimated time savings

Step 5: Download
- Click "Download Optimized DST"
- Save to computer
- Test on scrap fabric before production
- Keep original file as backup

OPTIMIZATION LEVELS EXPLAINED:

Light Optimization:
- Removes jumps > 10mm
- Preserves all design elements
- Safest option
- Minimal risk
- Best for: First-time use, important projects

Medium Optimization (Recommended):
- Removes jumps > 7mm
- Reduces excessive trims
- Balances efficiency and safety
- Suitable for most designs
- Best for: General use, tested designs

Aggressive Optimization:
- Removes jumps > 5mm
- Maximum trim reduction
- Significant file size reduction
- Higher risk of altering design
- Best for: Problematic files, experienced users who will test first

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

What Gets Removed:
- Long jump stitches between sections
- Redundant trim commands
- Excessive color changes (if same color)
- Unnecessary path optimization

What Gets Preserved:
- All visible stitches
- Design shape and size
- Stitch density
- Intentional color stops
- Specialty stitch types

Algorithm:
- Analyzes stitch-by-stitch
- Identifies inefficient jumps
- Calculates optimal path
- Removes safe-to-remove elements
- Rebuilds DST with same visual result

WHEN OPTIMIZATION HELPS:

Problem: Commercial machine creates long thread tails
Solution: DST Optimizer removes excessive jumps causing tails

Problem: Design has too many trim commands (machine pauses frequently)
Solution: Optimizer consolidates trims

Problem: DST file is unusually large (slow to load)
Solution: Optimization reduces file size 20-50%

Problem: Design from unknown source stitches poorly
Solution: Clean up inefficient pathing

ARTAPLI DESIGNS AND OPTIMIZATION:
Note: Artapli designs are pre-optimized during creation
- Already have efficient pathing
- Jump stitches are intentional and minimal
- No need to optimize Artapli DST files
- Use optimizer for DST files from other sources

WHY DST FORMAT:
DST is universal format but:
- No embedded optimization data
- Different digitizers use different standards
- Machine settings vary
- Optimizer standardizes for best results

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
Always:
✓ Keep original file before optimizing
✓ Test optimized file on scrap first
✓ Start with Light optimization
✓ Compare visual appearance after optimization
✓ Document settings that work for your machine

Never:
✗ Optimize without testing first
✗ Use Aggressive mode without experience
✗ Optimize specialty designs (fringe, puffy) - use original
✗ Optimize multiple times (degrades quality)

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Issue: Optimized file looks different
Solution: Use lighter optimization level. Some jumps may be intentional.
Return to original file.

Issue: Design stitches poorly after optimization
Solution: Original had intentional jumps for fabric relief. Use original
or try Light optimization only.

Issue: File won't process
Solution: Check file is valid DST format. Try different browser. Verify
file not corrupted.

Issue: No improvement in file size
Solution: File was already optimized. No action needed.

BATCH PROCESSING:
For multiple files:
- Process one at a time
- Document settings used
- Test first file before batch-processing others
- Keep consistent optimization level for similar designs

MOBILE COMPATIBILITY:
DST Optimizer works on:
- Smartphones
- Tablets
- Desktop computers
- Any device with modern browser

PRIVACY:
- Files processed locally in browser
- No upload to server
- No data collection
- Completely private
